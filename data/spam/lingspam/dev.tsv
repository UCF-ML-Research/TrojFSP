Subject: query : stieber 's law  if i may , i would like to repeat a query i posted some time ago to which i received no responses : does anybody know who first proposed that analogical change cannot introduce new phonemic contrasts into a language ? the earliest reference i have found is a paper by z . stieber , written in polish in the 1930 's , but i think this must go back further . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i did receive one response ( from harry bochner ) regarding possible counterexamples to this , namely , it has been assumed that glottalized / y / in navaho is always of analogical origin . there are numerous other claimed examples of this in the literature , but most of them appear to be quite spurious ( e . g . , ukrainian and belorussian / dzh / ( voiced alveolopalatal affricate ) mentioned by jakobson , and certain umlauted vowels in swiss german mentioned by moulton and kiparsky ) . 	0

Subject: re : 3 . 402 queries : language - speakers , syntax , texts  the folks concerned with speaking a lot of languages would include those directing the mormon missionary effort and those who run the schools for diplomats ( etc . ) assigned to a variety of foreign postings . such people are very clever at developing language skills in their students but in part because they are remorselessly practical ( i . e . anti-theoretical ) . it strikes me that the popularity of language instruction by the intuitive method may explain in part why knowledge of grammar ( any sort of rudimentary grammar ) is no longer very common in the general population . lots of people get a dose of english grammar in middle school , but i wonder if that sort of thing will stick when it simply seems to tell you ( or even to misrepresent ) what you know already . if only seventh-grade grammar teachers could convince their students that it is interesting to see how systematically you behave without knowing it ! but this is the age at which one 's children may raise their voices in protest if you seem to be lecturing them about an area in which they lay claim to adult competence . . . . - - rick 	0

"Subject: physics : culture dependent or independent ?  i ' m currently into a bit of a slinging match with a physicist who reckons physics is culture independent . physicists do not , according to his view , create their concepts , but discover them by observation of the facts . he seems to be convinced that if physics had been persued by the navahos or by some highland papuans first ( his and my examples in private discussion ) it would be exactly the same kind of physics than the one developed in the west that we know now . has anyone some views on this ? i ' m trying to tell him he is wrong . or am i ? to help me prove my case ( if there is a case to be proven ) , could anyone come up with languages where there is no concept for the ( physical ) concept of "" force "" ? my discussant 's view is that if in a language there is no such concept it will be created , because the physical forces of western physics are just there , in the world , for us to be observed . my view is that without such a concept , there is no guarantee that you must develop a kind of physics which is "" western "" in outlook . i need help ! ! thanks . please send general comments ( first question ) to the list , and examples of languages to me . i ' ll summarize . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr bert peeters tel : + 61 02 202344 department of modern languages 002 202344 university of tasmania at hobart fax : 002 207813 gpo box 252c bert . peeters @ modlang . utas . edu . au hobart tas 7001 australia "	0
Subject: proposal for a morphological database of classical greek  i am writing to seek input on a proposal that we tentatively plan to submit to the neh at the end of the summer . the idea is fairly simple : we want to use the morphological parser that we have been developing for the past eight years or so to generate morphological analyses of every unique string in the thesaurus linguae graecae ( tlg ) , the database of greek texts available on cd rom from uc irvine . the tlg is large - - 42 million words at present and a new version is due out later this year with 57 million words . greek is a highly inflected language - - not as bad as georgian and some others , but a verb can , with prefixes , have millions of different forms . the tlg corpus extends over a thousand years and includes virtually all literary greek , and thus would support diachronic as well as synchronic linguistic analysis . i would like to know if there is anything we could do that would make this work on greek useful for the linguistics community in general ? classicists need this database , but it would be very exciting if it could stimulate additional work . the working summary of the project follows . the proposal outline is fairly succinct ( c . 7 pages ) but it is full of greek and does not lend itself readily to transliteration . if you would like to see a copy , please send me your us mail address and we will send one to you . casual reactions to just this summary are , however , more than welcome . note : reactions need not be positive . if this does not seem a worthwhile thing to pursue , i would love to know why . thanks ! gregory crane department of classics boylston 319 harvard university cambridge ma 02138 crane @ ikaros . harvard . edu a linguistic database of classical greek this project will extend an existing parser for classical greek , expanding its database of stems to cover the majority of all words attested in the literary record , and will use this database to create a morphologically parsed database of more than 1 , 000 , 000 unique strings available in the tlg : in the end , we will publish the database of analyzed strings , the databases of stems and endings which drive the parser and the parser itself . the resulting databases are an essential piece of scholarly infrastructure that will ( 1 ) revolutionize current searching techniques for the tlg and other greek databases , ( 2 ) make it possible to apply more sophisticated retrieval / text analysis to greek texts , and ( 3 ) provide a basic but crucial lookup tool that will aid non-specialists in other fields ( e . g . , philosophy , political science , religion ) who seek to work directly with the greek database . note : this document is a sketch for a possible proposal to be submitted to the neh at the end of august 1992 . it is , in effect , a proposal for a proposal and is thus open to revision on any and all points . 	0

"Subject: query : sexist example sentences  i know that some time in the past ( the 70 's ? ) some linguists became aware of the tendency to perpetuate sexist stereotypes in example sentences ( "" john is a doctor "" ; "" mary is a nurse "" ) , leading to the use of gender-neutral names in examples ( kim , sandy , chris , etc . ) . my question is : did anyone ever do ( and maybe publish ) a study of this tendency in actual example sentences in linguistics textbooks or articles ? thanks . monica macaulay "	0

this is really a two fold question . let 's talk about the selling of report # 5599 first . all you have to do is place an ad , mail the postcards or send bulk email . if you place an ad send the respondent this sales letter and let this sales letter do the rest for you - no need to talk to anyone ! ! if you mail the postcards or use bulk emailing your job is done ! the postcard will ask the respondent to send $ 50 . 00 to your mailing address . email will work for you if you send it to as many people as you can . if you decide to become an offshore broker and qualify to receive over-rides and commission on the offshore business support services the parent company will do the selling for you if you wish . this is a "" no brainer "" and can be as simple or as complicated as you want to make it . . . talk to the people if you wish or do n't - report # 5599 sells itself ! q . how many hours a week will i have to devote to my business ? a . one to sixty hours a week ! here 's a question i will answer with a question . . . how much money do you want to make ? common sense says the more ads you run and the more mailings you do the more money you will make ! the statistics show that for every 100 responses you receive from your ads , and you mail this sales letter , you will sell five to ten reports making you $ 250 . 00 to $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . your ad responses will vary depending on the place you advertise and the circulation of the publication . the more ads you run or the more emails you send out the more time you will need to devote to your home based business . q . just how much money will i need to start my home based business ? a . $ 50 . 00 ! yeah i know - you ' re thinking you will need money for ads and mailing . well - i ' ve had people start with $ 50 . 00 ( u . s ) and make ten copies of the report and sold them to their associates and friends giving them $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . that gave them enough money to start running ads and to buy stamps . in looking at all the money making opportunities offered in the world today i really do n't think you can get started for any less than $ 50 . 00 and have a better legitimate money-making opportunity than the one offered in report # 5599 ! q . if i have additional questions who will answer them for me ? a . i will or the parent company will ! no package of information , no matter how complete , can possibly answer every question that may come up . i do not want you to lose money seeking out the answers . i want you to succeed ! you will receive a phone number in report # 5599 where you can either reach me or someone from the parent company for any question or help you need ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ here 's a valuable bonus for ordering within 5 days . . . . your 's absolutely free !

Subject: query : preserving field recordings  i have a question about preserving regular * analog * recordings made in the field . i work in rural chinese , and for the most part i collect inventories of lexicon , along with some texts . for ordinary background recording of interviews i have been using a $ 45 panasonic microcassette recorder on half-speed , which does * quite * serviceably even without an external mic . i intend to use ordinary high-bias non-metal cassettes for material i want to work with in some detail , such as stories , conversations , and recitation . i can transfer that to micro-cassette for transcription , so that the master remains in good condition . what concerns me is finding a way to preserve material originally made on analog tape . tapes mildew rapidly in taiwan and southern china , and even in seattle and new york i have had tapes become unplayable after a number of years in storage . i was thinking that if there were some inexpensive and painless way to digitize ordinary analog tapes , i could transfer them to cd here at my school , for only the price of the cd itself ( about $ 12 ) . one problem is wasted space : i can only fit 74 minutes of uncompressed sound on a cd , because one seems to have no choice but to record in stereo , even if the original source is mono . does anyone have any experience with this ? i could get far more material onto a cd if i compressed it but i do n't want to do that , because i have no confidence that today 's compression protocols will be readable in 20 or 50 years - remember the data from the 1960 us census , which was stored on magnetic tape and could no longer be read by the mid - 1980 's ? if something is important enough to preserve on cd , i do n't want it to become unreadable in a few decades . i 'd appreciate hearing any ideas on long-term storage . also , if anyone has ideas about why digital equipment might still be preferable for my work , i 'd like to hear them . i will summarize the responses i get . sincerely , david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 usa < charmii @ u . washington . edu > web : http : / / weber . u . washington . edu / ~ yuenren / circular . html 	0

"Subject: summary : chomsky 's "" single mutation ""  a couple of weeks ago i posted a query about an alleged quotation from chomsky . the quote came from gordon hewes , an anthropologist and a specialist in language origins , in his 1977 paper ` language origin theories ' in duane rumbaugh 's book _ language learning by a chimpanzee _ , on page 43 . there hewes asserts that chomsky has explicitly attributed the human language faculty to a single genetic mutation in one of our ancestors . the source was given as "" chomsky ( 1967 ) "" , but no such item appears in hewes 's bibliography , nor indeed any works by chomsky at all . i therefore asked if anybody could point to such a statement in chomsky 's works . i received seven responses , most of them from people who either know chomsky personally or who take a professional interest either in chomsky 's work or in language origins . no one was aware of any such statement by chomsky , either in print or elsewhere , and a couple of people flatly disbelieve that chomsky has ever said any such thing . i myself have tracked down and read all of chomsky 's 1967 publications which might be relevant , and i can find no such suggestion in any of them , though two of them do make passing remarks on language origins . i have also skimmed through chomsky 's books _ cartesian linguistics _ ( 1966 ) , _ language and mind _ ( 1968 , 1972 ) and _ knowledge of language _ ( 1986 ) without finding any such statement ( though i have n't read them carefully ) . it appears , then , that chomsky has made no such suggestion , and that hewes 's statement must result from some kind of error or misunderstanding . i find this odd , though , since hewes is well known as a specialist in language origins and since the remark occurs in the middle of a generally well-documented survey of earlier suggestions on the origin and evolution of language . most peculiar . my thanks to keith mccormick , robert freidin , scott delancey , vivian cook , rich hilliard , massimo piattelli - palmarini , and raf salkie for their helpful responses . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk "	0

"Subject: query : pseudo - explanations  i am trying to collect examples of pseudo-explanations of linguistic phenomena which invoke supposed beliefs or customs such as the following : ( a ) hopi pluralizes the word for ' cloud ' the way that it usually pluralizes only animate nouns , so whorf claimed that this proves that the hopis believe clouds to be alive , ( b ) malagasy and some other languages tend to use passive rather than active voice forms in imperatives , so it is has often been claimed ( i even did this myself once ) that this is a matter of politeness , because by using a passive you are avoiding actually ordering the addressing around , while still making it clear what you want done . ( c ) one of the languages of the torres straits uses the dual in speaking to a married woman , and this was explained by saying that a married woman was assumed to have a child with her ! ! ! ( d ) there is even the famous case of a russian work which claimed that the adjective * beremennyj * ' pregnant ' had no masculine forms ( like the one i just cited ) because only females can get pregnant and then used this very form , saying that a "" beremennyj muzhchina "" ( = "" pregnant - masc man "" ) is inconceivable ! these are the kinds of things i would like to collect . and it would be especially if there were a case where the explanation was valid and not pseudo , of course , please send the examples to me and i will post a summary .

"Subject: "" syntax and the comparative method  concerning syntax and the comparative method : if i understand it correctly , amr @ ares . cs . wayne . edu ( no name ) apparently believes that under certain circumstances one can indeed use syntax as part of the comparative method and cites among other things , the case of a neuter plural in classical greek and old iranian used with a verb in the singular and its possible implications for a similar structure in the proto - language . while i do in theory believe that a particular construction can indeed survive the ravages of time and give us clues to the syntax of earlier levels , this must always be the last criterium we apply and can almost never be used as a sort of proof - unless of course , ( i believe scott de lancey mentioned it , but i ' m not sure ) we can show that , for example , all ergative case endings ( i believe the example was tibeto - burman ) can be traced back to a common form and the morphology , when reconstructed from the 'd aughter ' languages , conclusively points , in this case , to an ergative ' mother ' language . otherwise , john cowan seems to have summed it up best , citing robbin burling 's book : man 's many voices . . . just as every language at one point or another borrows lexemes from another langauge , there are literally thousands of examples of langauges borrowing syntactic constructions from other languages , whether substrats or not - even english has a good share of these borrowings . we cannot forget that an extremely large portion of the world 's population is by necessity bi - or tri-lingual , many of whom cannot even read their own native language , not to mention the other ( s ) or have any kind of linguistic training or sensiti - vity and would therefore pay much attention as to what language a particular construction comes from . there are also the famous ' sprachbunds ' , such as the balkan area and to a certain extent south asia , where through everyday necessity , a large part of the population speaks at least two langauges , as was shown in the case of the village along the maharastra - mysore boundary , ( mentioned by john cowan above ) where one can translate word-for - word from one language into another , although the languages are not - strictly speaking - related . in this case , though , it does n't even seem to make sense to speak of language families . in my opinion , the only possible connection is that of language contact or sprachbund . maybe that is part of the problem - what are ' related ' languages , anyway ? we must also remember that this process has undoubtedly been going on ever since people could speak . it would n't be difficult to propose , going back to our starting point , a theoretical language contact area for greek and iranian . for example , georgian , at least the modern language , only uses the plural verb for humans . although objects can appear in the plural , the verb appears in the singular . as there have always been greek ' colonies ' throughout the region , one could just as well assume a kind of sprachbund for the whole region at that time , which would be even easier as we know so little about the pre-historic era in that region , making it difficult to disprove . even today , there are certain ' areal ' characteristics such as evidential perfects , and many languages are , or have been at one point , split ergative in the region stretching from nepal to the caucusus , etc . seen in this light , then , we can't really speak of the ' oddity ' of the construction with a neutral plural taking a verb in the singular , which , by the way , in my opinion at least , does have a certain semantic justification and is by no means ' odd ' . concerning indo - aryan , the comparative method applied to syntax would certainly give us the ( wrong ) conclusion that vedic sanskrit was a split-ergative language , as all modern indo - aryan languages except standard oriya and begali ( and assamese ? ) are either ergative or split - ergative languages , and many dialects of these three langauges are also split-ergative languages . as there are several hundred ia ' langauges ' , would n't we be forced to assume that this goes back to the parent language ? but there is also a problem here with the traditional method . we have ( to a large extent ) cognate endings for the ergative case . so why is n't vedic a split-ergative language ? because we have gone back too far . split ergativity is part of the ' parent ' language , but this is presumably to be found in middle indic . for a language family about which we know next to nothing , then , this would certainly lead to tremendous errors . so , it seems to me that , although there are indeed useful insights to be gained by looking at the syntax , it should , as i stated earlier , always be the last criterium , if used at all , in arguing for a kind of genetic relationship . when we have no written history of the peoples of the area , very little in the way of documented sound changes , etc . , we simply cannot say anything yet about the syntactic structure of the proto-language . that will undoubtedly come about in the course of time , but it is just one of many features , none of which alone can ' prove ' anything , except perhaps contact . if there are enough of the ' unlikely ' correspondences ( i . e . ' ist / sind ' and ' est / sunt ' ) , then one can speak with relative security of a genetic relationship , whatever that exactly means . john peterson , kiel , germany "	0
"Subject: re : sum : native speaker intuitions  marilyn silva recently summarised responses dealing with "" native speaker intuitions "" , especially with respect to the sentence ' john asked mary to leave ' . she notes that several respondents pointed out that the interpretation of this sentence is determined , at least in part , pragmatically , and the view that the interpretation is syntactically fixed is wrong . this point is demonstrated by the ) pair of examples : ) ) [ 1 ] the teacher asked the child to leave the room . ) [ 2 ] the child asked the teacher to leave the room . i am a native speaker of english ( new zealand english ) , and i am not a syntactician , so i do n't think my syntax is being moulded by my , or anyone else 's , rules or theories , but , in both [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] , i can only interpret the person being asked ( the child in [ 1 ] , the teacher in [ 2 ] ) as being the person required to leave the room . no amount of ) intuition fatigue ( which could be summed ) up as "" say a weird string 50 times and it sounds good ; say a ) good string 50 times and it sounds weird "" ) has been able to change my interpretation of this kind of sentence . perhaps for some people the interpretation of this sentence * is * syntactically determined . the summary concludes with : ) in his post to me , carson contends that judgment data "" can ) provide real , useful data , if we would just be more systematical ) and careful about how we collect them . of course speakers will ) differ on certain points . . . . the interesting question is whether ) the range of variation we find is systematically constrained in ) ways that interesting theories of grammar can explain . "" i agree that ( native ) speakers will differ on certain points - - my syntax probably differs from that of most people , and i think this is probably typical ( in my case the following ( a ) sentences are ungrammatical and would normally be the ( b ) sentences : 1 . ( a ) i promised mary to leave . ( b ) i promised mary i would leave . 2 . ( a ) candidates are recommended to obtain the booklet . ( b ) it is recommended that candidates obtain the booklet . 3 . ( a ) john requires to pass the examination . ( b ) john needs to / must pass the examination . john requires a pass in the examination . s . o . requires john to pass the examination . 4 . ( a ) i saw the barn red . ( b ) ? ? ? it is important that syntactitions realise that one there are probably thousands of syntactically distinct englishes out there , and i am not talking about socially or geographically definable varities . there may not be many new zealand english speakers who share the above judgments , but * my * english is no less based on a natural language grammar than anyone else 's . because the interpretation of a certain construction may be influenced by pragmatic factors is some , or even in the majority , of speakers , does not disqualify a purely syntactic account if there are speakers whose language data are accounted for by it . where there is variation among langauge users , it is very important not to conflate these differences and try to base a grammar ( syntax / phonology . . . ) on an impure sample . untimately , a grammar is an account of an individual ' s language . student 's who disagree with data are rarely being contentious - - i contend that they have a slightly different grammatical structure which is , of course , no less valuable in the search for constraints on syntactic structure than the teacher 's or a "" received "" english grammar . i heartily endorse carson 's call for more systematic and careful collection of syntactic data . think about it - - is your english really syntactically the same as your colleague 's , or your father 's ? if not , care must be taken when conflating data from these sources , and even more care must be taken when conflating data from even more diverse sources . wayne p . lawrence "	0

"" is a european union funded project ( copernicus ' 93 project no . 10393 ) whose aim is to embed spoken natural language synthesis technology with sophisticated user interfaces in order to improve access to information systems . multimedia technology and knowledge-based text processing enhance the development of new types of information systems which not only offer references or full-text documents to the user but also provide access to images , graphics , audio and video documents . this diversification of the in formation offered has to be supported by easy-to - use multimodal user interfaces , which are capable of presenting each type of information item in a way that it can be perceived and processed effectively by the user . users can easily process simultaneously the graphical medium of information presentation and the linguistic medium . the separation of mode is also quite appropriate for the different functionalities of the main graphical interaction and the supportive meta-dialogue carried out linguistically . we believe , therefore , that a substantial improvement in both functionality and user acceptance is to be achieved by the integration of spoken languages capabilities . however , text-to - speech devices commercially available today produce speech that sounds unnatural and that is hard to listen to . high quality synthesized speech that sounds acceptable to humans demands appropriate intonation patterns . the effective control of intonation requires synthesizing from meanings , rather than word sequences , and requires understanding of the functions of intonation . in the domain of sophisticated human-machine interfaces , we can make use of the increasing tendency to design such interfaces as independent agents that themselves engage in an interactive dialogue ( both graphical and linguistic ) with their users . such agents need to maintain models of their discourses , their users , and their communicative goals . the speak ! project , which was launched recently as a cooperation between the speech research technology laboratory of the technical university of budapest and the technical university of darmstadt ( in cooperation with gmd-ipsi ) , aims at developing such an interface for a multimedia retrieval system . at ipsi , the departments komet ( natural language generation ) and mind ( information retrieval dialogues ) contribute to this project . the project is to construct a proof-of - concept prototype of a multimodal information system combining graphical and spoken language output in a variety of languages . the work involves four supporting goals : first , to advance the state of the art in the domains of speech synthesis , spoken text generation , and graphical interface design ; second , to provide enabling technology for higher functionality information systems that are more appropriate for general public use ; third , to significantly improve the public and industrial acceptance of speech synthesis in general and the hungarian text-to - speech technology elaborated within the project in particular ; and , fourth , to act as a focusing point for speech work in hungary . contact points : gmd / ipsi , darmstadt : john bateman e-mail : bateman @ gmd . de fax : + 49 / 6151-869 - 818 tel : + 49 / 6151-869 - 826 tu - budapest : g ' eza n ' emeth e-mail : nemeth @ ttt - 202 . ttt . bme . hu fax : + 36 / 1-463 - 3107 tel : + 36 / 1-463 2401 "	0

"Subject: re : sapir - whorf and what to tell students these days  here 's what i tell my undergrad and grad students about that same chapter in language files . i . e . , it 's difficult to even judge what 's going on with whorf unless you are simultaneously conversant with linguistics , american indian languages , and at least the insights of modern physics . first , the conclusion that is appropriate is that , as i showed in "" the demise of the whorf hypothesis "" ( berkeley linguistics society , 1978 ? ) , what whorf said has little or generally no relation whatever to the entire body of discussion that comes under the name "" ( sapir - ) whorf hypothesis "" . he showed decades before the critics came up with their own hypotheses , which they failed to name after themselves , that he would never have agreed with their characterization of his thoughts . simple test : read the lf chapter and then ask , "" who created the whorf hypothesis ? "" and a quick way to answer this is : what did whorf himself call it in his two or three references ? he called it the "" principle of linguistic relativity "" or the "" linguistic relativity principle "" . my own reading of whorf never finds the word "" hypothesis "" at all . so - - right off the bat , and this is a good way to teach scientific nomenclature , who turned whorf 's ' principle ' into a ( n ) ' hypothesis ' , and why ? it was n't whorf , because his designation was clear . so what is the difference between the two ? well , a principle is like an axiom in geometry : a starting point which is theoretically unverifiable - - it 's just a starting point . you want something else , you begin from a different starting point , and then you develop your hypotheses from there . next : what does whorf 's "" linguistic relativity principle "" have to do , if anything , with einstein 's "" relativity principle "" ( which i covered in my also bls , 1980 ? , paper , "" is whorf 's relativity einstein 's relativity ? "" ) . ah , now we ' ve gotten to the crux of it - - much against pinker 's stand ( which was copied and intensified in a lingua franca short bio of suzette elgin hayden recently , where a digression found its author saying that whorf cobbled together his theory from a few ill-translated snatches of apache - - echoing a pinker statement and relying on pinker 's quoting whorf correctly , which he did n't , about a canoe on a beach pointwise : which pinker identified as an apache sentence , but which whorf knew quite well was nootka in the pacific northwest rather than apache in the beachless desert ) , whorf was upping the ante on einstein , who argued that euclidian geometry , far from being universal , was applicable only to flat surfaces ; that for round surfaces , which most of reality is made up of , you need non - euclidian geometry . i . e . , when the phenomena change significantly , you have to change the tool you ' re using . well , that 's what whorf said too ( see heisenberg 's lament below ) , except he moved its domain from mathematics to natural human language ; hence : the truly aptly named "" principle of linguistic relativity "" as whorf himself named it . admittedly , this does n't make any sense until you see it in action , in "" an american indian model of the universe , "" where he posits a worldview without our tense / time ( past / present / future diorama or river of time ) , using manifested / manifesting ( plus other synonyms ) instead . that is : sae grammars / cultures give that aforementioned notion of "" time "" , which is supported and maintained by their tense systems ( though , admittedly , english is weird and gets it through the culture side of the language / culture system ) ; the hopi language / culture system has no such image of time , working from a different worldview principle that sees only cyclical , not linear , time - - round , not flat . most of the world 's grammars that have broken out of the latinate mold show that the particular time / tense system of sae is pretty much peculiar to western european languages - - hence a linguistic / cultural ontology of "" time "" as we know and practice it , and not the supposed universal we have so fondly believed it to be . side note : for one who reads whorf closely , he makes five or ten times more universalist statements than relativity statements in his writings , yet he is seen ( and reviled in a chomskyan universalist attitude ) as the relativist par excellent . so right from the get-go we see that 1 ) whorf did n't write and would n't agree with the hypothesis that someone ( s ) named after him ; 2 ) rather than being some deranged crackpot , he was merely literate : whorf was one of the few interdisciplinary thinkers between physics and linguistics in this century ; 3 ) whorf 's relativity principle had something important to do with einstein 's ; and 4 ) whorf was a universalist as well as a relativist - - he just had them in balance , a notable enough rarity in current academe , you must admit . if i may be so bold , alluding to your posting that "" no one has disproved whorf 's mild version of linguistic relativity ( let 's leave ling . determinism aside , or the stronger version . ) "" , even the mild version was n't his ! trace back like i did and you will find that whorf espoused neither strong nor weak versions of determinism , and relativity has nothing to do with determinism when you see it from the physics viewpoint above , as he did . if you read carefully , writers about the whorf hypothesis admit that even whorf did n't hold a strong version of determinism ( so if he did n't , who did ? and if nobody did , why bring it up ? ) , and that all the critics hold the weak version that they dreamed up ( even though whorf would n't hold it because it 's at least weakly deterministic and therefore newtonian ) . so what 's going on ? the problem is that whorf had already , from his acquaintance with physics , moved from newtonian monocausal determinism as an ideal into systems thinking - - where sometimes the opposite of one profound truth is another profound truth , where everything is interdependent , multicausal , interconnected : language shapes culture while culture is shaping language ; language shapes thinking while thinking is shaping language . the cumulative effect of the ( humboldt / boas / sapir - ) whorf hypothesis literature has been primarily to throw up a smokescreen around his ideas so that people , including grad students in linguistics , psychology , anthropology and sociology , won't read him in the original ( english ! ) . i tell my grad students that if they want to really find out what their discipline is about , go find out who their discipline is beating up on and read them ; and if you are so lucky as me to find someone that four major academic disciplines are ganging up on - - you know you ' ve hit a goldmine ! what in the world could be so important that four academic disciplines create a combined smokescreen ? because so few linguists in this century have availed themselves of the changes in thinking about reality that physics has been broadcasting during this entire century , few linguists are even qualified to step into what they did n't realize was an interdisciplinary debate in the history of ideas which whorf felt so comfortable in . i ' ll explain . i ' ll give you a synopsis of a talk i intend to give at a 100th birthday conference for benjamin whorf , which i intend to get funding for and hold in the bay area in spring 1997 . i call it "" heisenberg 's lament . "" you see , early in this century , that ' uncertain ' heisenberg was among the first to gain a ' glimpse ' into the subatomic world ; and , having done so , he rendered his opinion that , regarding the subatomic realm , "" we have reached the limits of our language . "" he said this for two reasons : 1 ) no matter how glibly western scientists talk about electrons , protons , neutrons , quarks , etc . , when we look into that realm there are no ' things ' , only processes and relationships ; but in order to make sense ( i . e . , complete sentences ) in sae languages , we need nouns - - and there 's nothing in the subatomic realm that you can , except willy-nilly , attach nouns to . and 2 ) given that , our most fundamental scientific terms such as "" same "" and "" different "" are useless . he did n't know then , and physics does n't know now , whether there are gazillions of electrons or just one electron with gazillions of manifestations . we have reached the limits of our language . fast - forward a few decades and whorf hears this in his physics classes at yale ( he has unpublished manuscripts on gravity in the yale archives ) , and ponders : hm , i wonder if this has anything to do with what prof . sapir said the other day about hopi not needing nouns to express ordinary propositions - - just "" rehpi "" , "" flashed "" , instead of "" it "" or "" the / a light flashed "" : because when you come right down to it , how is the flashing different from the light ? is "" light "" just a convenient grammatical fiction foisted upon us by sae grammar ? and as he pondered ' light ' being noun or verb , particle or wave , depending on how it 's viewed , he saw the universe in the same way , with different cultures taking different positions on the question . in this case , since hopi did n't seem to take too seriously the absence of nouns , perhaps , whorf surmised , hopi could be of use for physicists in exploring and reporting back about the quantum world , that realm that did n't have thingy nouns . fast - forward another few decades and physicist david bohm reads whorf ( which i confirmed personally in talking to him ) , and then , * in response * ( my attribution ) , writes _ wholeness and the implicate order _ , in which he , among other things , tries to make english more verby and performative in the "" rheomode "" - - a brilliant flop ; and then launches on the scientific community a view of the universe which does not contain our familiar notions of past / present / future time , but instead an implicate and explicate order of reality - - an "" inny / outty "" notion where the future is inside us working outward instead of some vague distant goal we are headed toward . an email acquaintance pointedly asked me what the difference was between bohm 's terminology and whorf 's terminology ; it took me 6 months to finally answer that there was none , except the hopis had had theirs for millennia longer . and then it hit me ! bohm , in his own maverick way , appropriated whorf 's answer to heisenberg 's lament in "" an american indian model of the universe "" and substituted more scientifically acceptable terminology ( implicate / explicate rather than manifesting / manifested ) to see how the notion of a universe without linear time would fly in the modern physics and academic community - - and it had qualified success . but - - bohm was no closer to knowing whether whorf had been accurate in his description of hopi than he had been before writing the book . and there had been so much bad press on the guy ! how was one to know , ultimately ? and here 's the part that almost no-one knows so far . in 1991 , in the last few months of his life , david bohm launched his most ambitious thought experiment to date : with some other physicists and a few psychologists and linguists , and sponsored by the fetzer institute , he enticed recognized american indian intellectual leaders ( and some of their elders ) to join in dialogue together in what i can only describe as a roundabout way of asking american indians whether whorf was accurate in his description of the ' timeless ' hopi worldview . but it became so much more ! the american indian leaders there had previously read bohm 's book and others , but the physicists knew nothing about native american worldviews and native american science methodologies , so the indians had to build a bridge over to them in private meetings before the three public days on the themes of time , space and language . during the day on time , whorf 's description of hopi came up , was read out loud , and discussed , though i do n't remember any hopis being present ; nevertheless , the other american indians present , mostly of algonquian tribes , gave what can only be called ' independent verification ' in scientific terminology by saying essentially : well , i can't speak for the hopi people , but that 's pretty much the way we do it . in fact , of the many whorf passages read or discussed in these dialogues , the physicists and the american indians present were usually willing to give whorf his points ( proving again , perhaps , the difficulty of being a prophet in one 's own country / discipline ! ) . but we ' re not done yet - - the best is yet to come - - the actual conclusion of heisenberg 's lament ! at the beginning of the first dialogue it was clear that the quantum physicists had their favorite realm to explore and talk about , and the american indians also had their own favorite realm . as we dialogued , it began becoming clear that those favorite realms had some fundamental principles in common : the only constant is flux ; everything that exists vibrates ; everything is interconnected such that the part implicates the whole . in fact , it became crystal clear that the last major obstacle to these realms being the same realm was really only terminological : the physicists are used to calling it "" the subatomic realm "" whereas the american indians for millennia have been calling it "" the spirit realm "" . now that 's a big enough surprise - - that modern physics is knocking on the door of spirit without really meaning to - - but not big enough , so now let 's take it home ! it puzzled the physicists just how the american indians should have foreknowledge of a realm they should n't know about , that the western scientific infrastructure had just recently led us to - - and the indians had no such scientific infrastructure ! and as the physicists gradually understood that , like hopi , the algonquian grammatical structures do not demand nouns , do not demand fictitious actors to embody actions ( that , as my mikmaq and blackfoot friends tell me , they can talk all day long in those languages and never utter a single ' noun ' ! ) , they finally had to admit that such languages were indeed much better suited to exploring that realm and reporting back than sae languages - - whorf 's reply to heisenberg 's lament was verified and agreed upon . when the phenomena of reality change in a dramatic way , you need to change the tool you ' re using . now , of course , the physicists were left with an even larger puzzle , to wit : how is it that these american indians have a language much better suited than sae languages to investigate and describe the inner workings of the subatomic realm - - a realm they are n't even supposed to know about ! ? ! as you can see by now , pinker - - like all other facile critics and unindicted co-creators of the so-called hypothesis - - is out of his league altogether in attempting to characterize a major player in one of the most important interdisciplinary discussions ever in the history of ideas . pinker , like chomsky , loves logic ( which grows out of the grammar of sae languages just as the philosophy of ' karma ' grew out of the grammar of ancient sanskrit , where it was used earliest as the linguistics term for 'd irect object ' ! ! ) , but has never really gotten with the program this century to replace binary / dualistic thinking with multivariable / multicausal / interdependent systems thinking . whorf heard the call , way back then , and may yet prove to have been an entire century ahead of his time in linguistics . even though we can think in systems for phonology and grammar , we have a tough time doing it for "" language and thought "" ; we feel we have to make them bipolar opposites such that they are distinct and one causes the other invariantly ; that 's why i so admired how slobin finally lost those monolithic terms and framed the question instead in terms of "" thinking for speaking "" - - the at least one kind of thinking where your thinking is very much at the mercy of the forms and categories of your language , per whorf . so tell your students , as i do , that the only way to get to the bottom of what whorf did or did not say is to read his essays in _ language , thought & reality _ for themselves , perhaps with the above thoughts as a guideline , and then figure out for themselves whether the sapir - whorf hypothesis smokescreen makes any sense .

"Subject: re : 6 . 1070 , disc : sex / lang , re : 1023  in the ongoing discussion of the "" epicene he "" , i think that perhaps we are making some headway on certain issues , but all kinds of new loose ends keep unraveling . what seems clearly established is that the 18th century grammarians of english did not invent this usage , since ( a ) it had existed in english for centuries , and ( b ) it seems to be a linguistic universal or something close to it , not a peculiarity of english however , i do not see why anyone should call me "" misandrist "" ( or "" mysandrist "" ) . if it is because my name could easily be taken to be a woman 's name ( although i happen to be a man ) , that would really be too bad . if it is because of my acceptance of the common view that almost all or perhaps all societies are in some important sense male-dominated , then that too would be inaccurate . i also believe that for several centuries of us and brazilian and so on history white people held black slaves and not vice versa , but that does not mean i hate white people . the whole issue of the sense in which it is true that men have dominated human societies is certainly in some respects a subtle one , and one could certainly argue that this dominance has done us little if any good , but i do not see how one can deny that it is a fact . however , for the purposes at hand , this is not germane . what is relevant is ( a ) the linguistic fact that languages that make any kind of gender or sex distinction in pronouns or verb forms or anything else , as a rule use the male or masculine forms as unmarked forms for persons of either or unknown gender in some constructions ( which may differ from language to language in detail ) , and ( b ) the anthropological fact that all or nearly all human societies make social distinctions based on sex which go beyond reproduction , breast-feeding , and the like , and ( c ) the further anthropological fact that the male roles / activities are routinely perceived as somehow superior , dominant , better , normative , whatever ( regardless of whether they really are , which is a completely different issue ) . so what it all boils down to , again , is that i maintain that it makes no sense whatever to discuss the origin of the epicene he phenomenon in the context of the story of english prescriptive grammar , but only in the context of the way in which perceptions of sex roles have informed the structure of language ( as of any other institution ) . alexis manaster ramer "	0

"Subject: sum : german / english translation software  a little while ago i posted a query about peoples 's experience with power translator ( professional ) software for german - english translation . here is my colleague 's summary of responses via this and other lists . 1 . a second hand comment that someone working in art history had found it unsatisfactory 2 . another said that the canadian government uses the power professional ( french ) programme for translation work 3 . another said that the french version gave quite comical or incomprehensible results , but this was on the basic version , not the professional . one conspicuous difficulty was with words which can have the same form as different parts of speech ( eg gerunds ) ; another was variant word order . 4 . someone said ( another second hand comment ) that it was "" ok for the first cut "" . 5 . a response from the correspondent of an owner of the basic german programme who sent some samples with commentary , showing that as long as you knew both languages and edited the text during translation the results could be satisfactory , but whether the degree of efficiency offsets the time taken to use the programme was not apparent . this correspondent referred to it as a "" toy "" . 6 . a response from an academic who worked on the ibm translation product who referred to a german computer journal which rated the ibm programme slightly better ( and cheaper ) than the power professional . the reference is _ dos die pc zeitschrift _ 8 ' 95 pp128 - 132 . it is apparent that simple constructions and explicit vocabulary translate more accurately than the complex and allusive , so the satisfaction given will depend very much on the nature of the task and the needs or expectations of the user . for scanning large volumes of print to ascertain the general subject matter these programmes are probably quite satisfactory ; for accurate translations , interactive operation by a translation-competent person would seem to be necessary . i have not yet decided to buy one of these programmes : i await a sales person who is prepared to run the risk of a trial translation on text supplied by me . no satisfied user came forward . andrew carstairs - mccarthy department of linguistics , university of canterbury , private bag 4800 , christchurch , new zealand phone + 64 - 3-364 2211 ; home phone + 64 - 3-355 5108 fax + 64 - 3-364 2065 e-mail a . c-mcc @ ling . canterbury . ac . nz "	0

Subject: simultaneous prepositions and postpositions in pashto  i ' m looking for analyses of nominal constructions ( in any language ) in which the np has _ both _ a preposition and a postposition . for example , pashto has constructions like the following , from herbert penzl , _ a grammar of pashto _ ( washington , d . c . : american council of learned societies , 1955 ) , p . 41 : we sarri te to man to ' to the man ' the preposition is sometimes optional , though the postposition is obligatory . since pashto is head-final ( the unmarked word order is sov ) , it 's tempting to take the postposition at face-value . however , there are some binding facts that suggest that a phrase containing an np + postposition is referential , and so it might be possible to analyze the postposition as some kind of case marker . i understand that there may be such a distinction between homophonous case markers and postpositions in japanese , for example . i 'd be grateful if anyone could suggest any articles that deal with these constructions . and if there are other linguists who are studying pashto , i 'd like to hear from you . thanks for any help ! taylor roberts < troberts @ mit . edu > 	0
"Subject: words that are their own opposites ( part 2 )  in my last summary ( linguist 6 . 74 ) i listed a collection of what i call auto-antonyms - - words that have two opposite meanings . for example , to "" clip "" may mean to cut a little piece off , or to put a little piece on . to "" look over "" may mean careful scrutiny or that you missed an important detail . sometimes the antonymy may be historical : "" nice "" used to denote an unpleasant quality . in that summary , i promised a discussion of whether any generalities could be made about such pairs . are they regularly motivated , or always a coincidence ? i ' m still editing the responses to that question . meanwhile , here are more auto-antonyms that got left out of last post : one auto-antonym that i seem to have overlooked in preparing my post , although i remember looking it over many times before , is "" moot "" , which at once means "" suitable for debate "" and "" not worth discussing "" . impregnable : able to impregnated or inable to be pregnated , as joel hoffman points out . cope ( s ) mate : used to mean antagonist and now means partner or comerade , says ariadna solovyova , who got the word off of anu garg 's a . word . a . day mailing list . it turns out that they were having a week celebrating "" fence-setters "" , evidently another term for what i ' ve been calling auto-antonyms . bruce nevin reminds us of an intercontinental auto-antonym pair : "" public school "" in britain is "" private school "" in the usa and vice versa . infer : historically ( and now , informally ) this means "" imply "" as well . rent , lease : several pointed out to me that these means both lend and borrow . in addition , dan myers wrote to tell me that chinese operates similarly with respect to this pair , and wolfgang lipp notes a similar auto-antonymy to represent "" give "" and "" take "" in pronunciation ( shou4 ) but not in writing . learn / teach : in "" sub "" - standard english , these two meanings fuse into "" learn "" , as they do in standard russian "" uchit ' "" here are some of my personal favorites that i left out of the first summary : sensitive : this may describe either someone with profound understanding for the feelings of others , and tolerates differences of opinion ( thus "" sensitivity training "" for group leaders ) as well as a paranoid who does n't listen to what people are really saying , and decides to take everything as a personal insult . hole / whole : spelled the first way , an entire absence of matter ; the second , entire presence . this reminds me of "" pit "" which can be either a hollow or the stone of a fruit . which reminds me of "" seeded "" oranges ( insert your favorite fuit here ) - - oranges with seeds ( as opposed to navel oranges , which have no seeds ) , or oranges that have had their seeds removed . if you think you ' re beginning to see some patterns here , you ' re not alone ! as i said , i ' ve received a few theories on the ultimate essence of auto-antonymy , historical , psychological , and sociological approaches . these theories show that auto-antonymy comes about for a variety of reasons . in a short while , i ' m going to put up a summary of these theories . then , i ' ll briefly cover related linguistic phenomena , such as words with synonyms that look suspiciously like antonyms : flammable / inflammable , ravel / unravel . oh , and by the way , it turns out i was not the first to come up with the term "" auto-antonym .

"Subject: summary of names of days  dear linguists , in the december 15 issue of linguist i posted a request for examples of deictic expressions for the names of days either side of "" today "" . here is the summary of what i obtained . the response was overwhelming - a total of 70 linguist subscribers sent replies . many , many thanks to all of you who contributed . quite a number of respondents supplied information on two or more languages . there was some duplication of languages , namely japanese , mandarin chinese , danish , french , german , russian and hindi . i now have examples of 48 languages , they are : anejom ( vanuatu ) , a = fee a = fee ( solomon is ) , azerbaijani turkish , basque , bauan ( standard fijian ) , brazilian portuguese , bulgarian , czech , danish , dutch , english , erromagan ( vanuatu ) , estonian , finnish , french , german , hausa , hawai ` ian , hindustani , ipili ( png ) , italian , japanese , kamhmu ? ( vietnam ) , ki - swahili , kope ( png ) , korean , lao / phasa iisaan , lenakel ( vanuatu ) , madarin chinese , malay , mauritian / seychelles creole , modern greek , modern hebrew , norwegian , polish , quechua , rumanian , russian , samoan , serbo - croatian , slovene , sulka ( png ) , swedish , taiwanese , thai , welsh . my original interest in collecting such deictic expressions stems from a general interest in symmetry in language and language systems . most languages exhibit a symmetry in the number of deictic expressions for diurnal units either side of "" today "" , however , some exhibit an asymmetry . c . s . levinson ( pragmatics , 1983 : 75 ) reports , "" the amerindian language chinantec has four named days either side of today ; japanese has three days back from today , and two ahead ; hindi has the same word for yesterday and tomorrow . "" ( levinson gleaned this information from : fillmore , c . j . ( 1975 ) . santa cruz lectures on deixis , 1971 . mimeo , indiana university linguistics club . ) i have not personally been able to get a hold of this the fillmore reference - living in the academically isolated south seas does have some drawbacks ! if any of you have a copy of this publication , i would be very interested in obtaining photocopies of the section on ` time deixis ' . of course , i will reimburse you for the cost of postage and photocopying . anyway , a symmetrical deictic system of diurnal units / spans seems to me logical , though i ' m not sure i can verbalise the reasons . the reported asymmetry in the japanese system seemed to me a bit odd . especially that the asymmetry was lop-sided towards the past ( see below for reasons ) . upon further examination , i discovered that the japanese deictic system for diurnal units does seem to be symmetrical ; it has + 3 and - 3 either side of the present diurnal span . the expression ` siasatte / yanoasatte ' meaning + 3 days from "" today "" is not known to quite an number of native speakers of japanese . they appear to be used infrequently and ` yanoasatte and yaneasatte ' are considered to be dialectal ( at least in relation to the tokyo dialect ) . indeed , the lecturer in japanese in my department ( herself a native speaker of japanese ) was not aware of these expressions until she looked them up in her dictionary . another interesting consideration in all of this is the question as to the number of diurnal units before and after today that languages recognise . what is the maximum / minimum number of units ? also , what is the average number of units ( or most popular system ) ? answers to these questions ( based on my small sample ) below . one respondent asked the following very interesting question : "" if you reach the level of , let 's say , 5 ( days after present diurnal span ) , does this also have the non-specific reading ` at some point in the not-to - far-away future ' in those languages ? "" the only language in my small corpus that has + 5 and - 5 diurnal units in its system is erromangan ( vanuatu ) . i will have to ask my source for erromangan to answer this question . there is an inherent problem in determining the number expressions for diurnal units . this is determining whether the expressions are lexemes or phrases . many languages seem to have "" lexicalised "" ( for want of a better term ) prepositional / nominal phrases . other languages , like for example the english expression ` the day before yesterday ' , have retained the phrase structure . one respondent supplied me with a lengthy discussion on the lexeme / phrase issue . she cites the case of bulgarian ( i hope she won't mind my including her discussion here ) : [ begin quote ] bulgarian presents an [ interesting ] situation with regard to the phrase / lexeme issue because it does n't have a real nominal case paradigm : onzi den - 2 ( lit . "" that / yonder day "" ) vchera - 1 dnes 0 present diurnal span utre + 1 vdrugi den + 2 ( lit . "" other day "" ) so the same form ' pozavchera ' in bulgarian ( with stress on the penultimate syllable ; russian ' pozavchera ' has stress on the final syllable ) perhaps does n't look as strange because one would n't expect ' po ' to require any particular case ending . however , again we have what looks like a preposition with an adverb , which should not exist as a phrase . bulgarian "" tomorrow "" is ' utre ' . but "" the day after tomorrow "" is ' vdrugiden ' - - i . e . , the phrase ' v drugi den ' ( lit . "" on ( the ) other day "" , written without spaces in between the individual words . should this be considered a word simply on orthographic grounds , though ? is it a prepositional phrase or an adverb ? of course the boundary between prepositional phrases and adverbs is very fuzzy to begin with . bulgarian "" the day before yesterday "" , in contrast , is what looks like a noun phrase : ' onja den ' - - "" that day "" . no preposition ' v ' ( "" on "" ) here . so should this be considered just an np or a prepositional phrase ? ' onja den ' is used the same way as ' vdrugiden ' - - ' vidjax go onja den ' - - "" i saw him [ on ] the day before yesterday "" . it seems to me that what 's written as a noun phrase here is really an adverb , like ' vdrugiden ' or like russian ' pozavchera ' and ' poslezavtra ' , the only difference being that the other three adverbs are formed from prepositional phrases while ' onja den ' has no preposition . it would sound strange to call it a prepositional phrase , because , unlike ' vdrugiden ' , it contains no preposition . so i would call it an adverbial phrase . ( time expressions in slavic languages are commonly in the accusative , and that may be the origin of ' onja den ' , but since modern bulgarian has lost its nominal case paradigm for the most part this makes it harder to determine the status of phrases like this one . ( cf . russian ' kazhduju nedelju ' ( "" each - acc week - acc "" ) , which means "" every week "" in an adverbial sense . ) bulgarian does n't have specific words for "" the day before the day before yesterday "" - - that would be , i think , ' v denja predi onja den ' ( "" on the day before the day before yesterday "" ) , but of course speakers would avoid that and just would say ' predi dva dena ' ( "" two days ago "" , lit . "" before two days "" ) . the same would be true for ' vdrugiden ' - - ' v denja sled vdrugiden ' is conceivably possible ( "" on the day after the-day - after-tomorrow "" ) , but speakers would say 's led dva dena ' ( "" in / after two days "" ) . so i think it may be very difficult here to draw a demarcation line here between the grammatical categories of words vs . phrases . [ end of quote ] quite a number of languages ( especially slavonic and germanic languages ) allow recursion of prepositions / prefixes to "" add on "" to the already existing deictic expressions . the extent to which this recursion can be practiced is limited only by pragmatic constraints . here are some nice examples : rumanian : ras-ras - ras-alaltaieri ( ? ) - 5 ras-ras - alaltaieri ( ? ) - 4 ras-alaltaieri - 3 alaltaieri - 2 ieri - 1 azi / astazi 0 present diurnal span miine + 1 poimiine + 2 ras-poimiine + 3 ras-ras - poimiine ( ? ) + 4 ras-ras - ras-poimiine ( ? ) + 5 etc . dutch : ( eer-eergisteren ) + 3 eergisteren + 2 gisteren - 1 vandaag 0 present diurnal span morgen + 1 overmorgen + 2 ( over-overmorgen ) + 3 danish : ( i for-forgars - 3 ) i forgars - 2 i gar - 1 i dag 0 present diurnal span i morgen + 1 i overmorgen + 2 ( i over-overmorgen + 3 the - 3 and + 3 forms are rather colloquial , but nevertheless perfectly idiomatic . further recursions of prefixes / prepositions are only used in jocular ways , and predominantly by children . finally , if you have read this far , you are about to be rewarded with a summary of the data i have at this point . number of diurnal units either side of "" today "" : symmetrical deictic systems - 1 0 + 1 no examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 23 examples - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 14 examples - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 3 examples - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - erromangan ( vanuatu ) asymmetrical deictic systems - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 3 examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 1 example - malay - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - hausa - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 1 example - colloquial spanish ( southern spain ) it 's interesting to note that no language in the sample employs the - 1 0 + 1 system . and the majority of asymmetrical systems are lop-sided towards the + side of the present diurnal span . why this should be so , i do n't know . however , this sample is very small and perhaps a larger sample would show no such lop-sidedness towards the + "" today "" side . are the languages that show a lop-sidedness in a state of change ? most languages have a symmetrical vowel system e . g . the same number of front vowels as back vowels . however , there are quite a number of languages with asymmetrical vowel systems . what lies behind this asymmetry ? the answer to this question may lie in the following scenario [ from : crowley , t . ( 1992 ) an introduction to historical linguistics , oup , pp . 200-201 ] suppose that in a language with a nice symmetrical five vowel system : i u e o a the vowel / e / beocomes raised towards / i / and ultimately merges merges with / i / . the resulting asymmetrical system : i u o a will put structural pressure on the system , and , in time , it would not be surprising to see / o / merging with / u / . if a system becomes asymmetrical ( or uneven ) so as to create some sort of ` gap ' , then a change is likely to take place as a way of plugging that ` gap ' , thereby re-establishing an even ( or symmetrical ) system . if this is indeed a natural process in phonological systems , perhaps analogous processes occur in other systems , like temporal deictic systems . a language with an asymmetrical temporal deictic system may be in the process of historical change and the ` gap ' plugged in due time . japanese may be a language that is in the process of losing its + 3 deictic term . if this is indeed the case , it would be interesting to see whether , in due course , this "" imbalance "" is "" balanced "" again by the loss of its - 3 deictic term . i do n't know how valid any of this is , i ' m just speculating . anyway , back to symmetry . the most symmetrical system of all is that found in hindi : tarso - 4 narso - 3 parso - 2 kal - 1 aaj 0 present diurnal span kal ( bihaan ) + 1 parso + 2 narso + 3 tarso + 4 where there are not only an equal number expressions for diurnal units either side of "" today "" , but the expressions on either side are the same . distinction between "" before today "" and "" after today "" is made through use of past or future tense of the verb . in looking at a language 's temporal deictic system i guess we must not fail to take account of a number of important linguistic / cultural aspects . among these would be : * the culture 's view of time . is it a linear view or a cyclical view ? * the language 's tense / aspect systems . * the historical development of its deictic expressions in short , we can't study deictics in isolation . we must look at how it meshes grammatically with the language . i would be very interested in any of your views on the reasons for symmetry and asymmetry we find in this area of deixis . also , if you are interested in adding to my list of languages , i 'd be very grateful to receive your contribution . thanks again to all those generous people who sent me so much interesting data and opinions . yours today , tomorrow and . . . jan tent department of literature and language school of humanities the university of the south pacific p . o . box 1168 suva fiji tel : ( 679 ) 313900 ext . 2263 fax : ( 679 ) 305053 e - mail : tent _ j @ usp . ac . fj = 09 "	0
Subject: re : 6 . 1078 , re : 1053 , english only ( bilingualism )  i am writing to ask alexis manaster ramer a simple question concerning the universality of certain phenomena : how come about a hundred languages are spoken in present-day russia despite the attempts to russify everyone ? this linguist seems to be very active , yet unfortunately he tends to generalize the information he is aware of , judging by his contribution to the discussion on he / she pronouns and his remarks concerning russian linguistic policies . i would like to tell him of a common example concerning various ethnicities in russia : in 1553 czar ivan the dreadful incorporated the mari , mordvin ( finnic ) , chuvash and tatars ( turkic ) nationalities into his state . nowadays these peoples live in the very heart of russia on the middle volga , and , apparently , enjoy their culture and languages . they have also contributed to the culture and language of the dominant nation . the infamous cossacks ( farmers living on the borders of the state and ready to resort to arms to protect them , a sort of michigan militia ) have preserved their language while acquiring a lot of culture from , say , mountaineers of the caucausus . yet they did not assimilate those peoples who still speak their languages . to draw parallels between nostratic universal processes and the language policies of russia might hardly be considered an appropriate example . it would rather be the opposite of the desired . valeri vassiliev st . john 's 	0

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / www . interwise . cc ( if you can't log into the site just call us , sometime the site is overloaded with hits ) call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully processed immediately * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * "	1

Subject: how 's it going ?  hello friend , my name is carl simmons . in october 1988 , i received this bulletin in the mail . naturally i was skeptical , but i decided to try it because i was heavily in debt at the time . i had everything to gain and nothing to lose . even if this program worked only a fraction of what the example showed , i would be a success ! well , i m adding this note here to tell you it does work ! i will never forget how it happened . i followed the instructions exactly . the total cost was about $ 46 . 00 including postage . i dropped the envelopes off a the post office on my way to work one day in late october hoping to earn a few dollars to buy christmas presents . the recipe i ordered from the person in the # 1 position came in about a week . i did not think much about it after that until a few weeks later when my boss told me my wife had called and i was needed at home immediately due to some emergency . i raced home in a panic , threw the apartment door open , and what a sight i saw ! my wife was standing over a pile of envelopes that the mailman had dumped on the living room floor from two big canvas bags . we spend the rest of the day and most of the night opening and counting 3 , 245 envelopes , each containing $ 2 . 00 and a self-addressed stamped envelope . the next day we received 4 , 274 more . by the time the orders stopped coming in , about two weeks later , i had received $ 92 , 428 . 00 in cash ! ( i wonder what the printer though when i had him print 46 , 000 copies of the recipes in one week ! ) needless to say , i immediately quit my job , paid off al my debts in full and started another mailing . to date my revenues are approaching $ 1 , 000 , 000 . 00 in cold hard cash . believe me , you can do the same thing . this is you lucky break that you have been hoping for all your life . you can make your dreams come true . . . do not pass it up ! the most difficult part was finding a good company to provide responsive names . after trying many name sources , i ran across two companies that provided the best names for this program . their addresses and prices are below : mjg advertising 200 names $ 24 . 00 p . o . box 3009 500 names $ 35 . 00 maple glen , pa 19002 1000 names $ 50 . 00 ( 215 ) 643-1328 2000 names $ 75 . 00 ( 800 ) 880-8143 marnico lists 200 names $ 20 . 00 p . o . box 2046 500 names $ 35 . 00 abington , ma 02351 1000 names $ 60 . 00 request # 3001 2000 names $ 95 . 00 making your fortune is as easy as following these six steps : 1 . send a self addressed stamped envelope and $ 2 . 00 cash wrapped in a sheet of paper specifying which recipe you are ordering by number , to addresses # 1 through # 5 at the end of this bulletin . 2 . order at least 200 names and addresses on labels from the companies mentioned earlier . 3 . while waiting for your labels to arrive , remove the name at the # 1 spot and move each of the names up one position . place your name and address in spot # 5 . move only the names and addresses - not the recipes . this can best be done by retyping the set and pasting the new over the original . 4 . have a local printshop print at least 200 copies of this bulletin . 5 . fold the printed bulletins and place in envelopes , seal and stamp them . 6 . when the labels arrive , place one on each envelope and mail them . now here s the best part - the money you can make ! here is what happens when only 10 % of the people respond to your mailing . you send out at least 200 with your name in position # 5 . 20 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 4 . 400 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 3 . 8000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 2 . 160000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 1 . 168420 x $ 2 . 00 each = $ 336840 in about 60 to 90 days ! ! ! of course you are not limited to mailing only 200 bulletins , or to just one mailing . send out more than 250 or do repeat mailings and you will drastically increase your earnings . when you receive 1 , 000 requests for recipe # 3 , sit back and relax knowing that you re soon going to be a very rich person . yes , this is a perfectly legal mail order marketing plan . if you are in doubt , then refer to title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws . a product or service must be exchanged for the money received ; in this case , the product is the recipes . this plan also takes honest work , but the rewards are tremendous . keep a careful account of all money you received and money you spend for income tax purposes . there you have it ! the secret to making thousands for yourself . read this bulletin carefully and then reread it again . think about it , do the math and consider the wealth potential this holds for you . then send $ 2 . 00 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope today to the addresses in positions # 1 below . go for it , order those recipes today . 1 . chocolate cream pie 2 . pineapple bavarian pudding henry w . frye , sr . harold lookwood 24684 atwood ave . 123 skokorat st . moreno valley , ca 92553 seymour , ct . 06483 3 . chocolate walnut cookies 4 . cheese garlic biscuits vincent myers , jr . dlh enterprises inc . 848 n . rainbow , # 351 p . o . box 5854 las vegas , nv 89107 san jose , ca 95150 5 . magic cookies bar acw enterprises p . o . box 3004-332 corvallis , or 97333 i tried a similar program in which the cost was $ 5 . 00 . in that one , the response was only about 3 % . the first time i sent out this recipe program a got my first responses in just one week . i sent out 250 letters instead of just 100 so my percentage of gains was higher . i am trying again with 500 letters to see if i can surpass the $ 141 , 236 . 00 of the last time . good luck to all of you . it really works ! ! ! sally freisch , st louis , il 	1

"" on this same note , stavros macrakis states : "" if the provenance [ of the e - text ] is not clear , i do n't know why you 'd want to cite the thing in the first place ! if i give you a half-dozen xerox copies without the necessary bibliographic information , you would be wise not to rely on them too much ! "" and finally an important note on etiquette from evelyn todd : "" if you wish to cite an item that you received via [ . . . e-mail lists ] , please consider if the posting was public or private and contact its author for permission to cite . postings can be considered as published material , but it is always wise to check with the author before assuming that widespread dissemination was intended .

"Subject: genetic classification  i wish to make some comments on an issue that recent discussion of nostratic and the problem of "" demonstrating "" distant genetic relationships has skirted around that i believe underlies some of the issues that various people have been directly addressing . an assumption that seems to underly much of the discussion is that hypotheses regarding genetic relationships are not interesting unless they can be proven to be true . i find this a rather odd assumption , and one that does not seem to be made about any other kinds of hypotheses in linguistics ( or anywhere else in science as far as i know ) . and let us set aside for the sake of argument the oft-noted point that the notion of proof is not really applicable to empirical hypotheses , and assume that the term is to be used loosely for some arbitrary high level of certainty . it seems fair to say that there is a fairly widespread disinterest in hypotheses like the nostratic hypothesis because it is widely believed ( and i will assume it is true here for the sake of argument ) that the available evidence for nostratic falls short of this imaginary level of certainty which deserves the label "" proven "" . a common type of reaction to unproven hypotheses is that it has not been demonstrated that the observed similarities might not be due to chance and / or borrowing . but suppose that someone were to take the same attitude towards comparative reconstruction of protolanguages . suppose that someone were to object to comparative reconstruction of anything but very shallow groups on the grounds that one can never prove that the reconstructions are correct . just as one can object to certain claims of genetic relationships on the grounds that one cannot conclusively eliminate the possibility that the observed similarities might be due to accident and / or borrowing , one could equally well object to virtually all hypotheses surrounding comparative reconstruction on the grounds that one cannot conclusively eliminate alternative possibilities . the comparative method is a way to come up with the best guess one can make about a protolanguage ; it never provides proof that the reconstruction is in fact correct . so why bother doing it ? the answer should be obvious : hypotheses which represent our best guesses at any point in time are what much of science is about . by why do so many linguists seem to object to applying the same way of thinking to hypotheses about genetic relationships ? why is it that many historical linguists find the hypotheses like the nostratic hypothesis either laughable or upsetting ? why do n't they react the same way to comparative reconstructions , since they also are "" unproven "" ? why do n't they rush out and read everything they can find on nostratic and conclude "" the evidence is tantalizing but not conclusive ; it 's a really exciting hypothesis "" ? why is there such a double standard ? i want to suggest an answer to this question , an answer which , if right , provides insight into the nature of many debates surrounding controversial hypotheses of genetic relationship . namely , some people find questions of genetic classification intrinsically interesting , quite apart from any detailed historical work that plays a role in supporting hypotheses . other people , however , are primarily interested in the detailed historical work itself , and do not find questions of genetic classification intrinsically interesting , but only interesting in so far as they are an inevitable consequence of historical work . people of the first sort are more likely to find recent work reclassifying penutian languages exciting , while people of the latter sort are unlikely to react that way , unless they are penutian specialists . as one moves back in time , the ability to apply the comparative method becomes increasingly difficult , and detailed historical work becomes increasingly speculative ( and to many historical linguists , dissatisfying ) . but at any time depth , we can always be much more confident of the genetic classification than we can of any comparative reconstructions . our confidence in indo - european as a language family is surely greater than our confidence in any specific claims about proto - indo - european . but as we move further back in time , we should expect there to be hypotheses that we cannot be entirely confident of , but for which there is at least some promising evidence , where any comparative reconstruction is going to be sufficiently speculative as to not be satisfying to linguists interested in traditional comparative work . and since these linguists are not interested in genetic classification except as a biproduct of detailed historical work , such linguists are likely to find the hypotheses uninteresting . on the other hand , for linguists who find questions of genetic classification inherently interesting , the fact that detailed historical work may not be possible is irrelevant , and the fact that the hypothesis is unproven or unprovable may be no more a source of concern than the fact comparative reconstructions are always unproven and unprovable . if this view is correct , much of the debate surrounding controversial hypotheses in genetic classification is based , not on substantive questions , but simply on what sorts of questions different people find interesting . matthew dryer "	0

( individual thanks are at the end of this message ) . here are the responses i received : the old gentlemen walking along the river are speaking french ( there was some disagreement as to whether it was parisian french or not , with people coming down on both sides ) ; the businessmen in the marketplace are speaking moroccan arabic ; the majority opinion was that the nuns are speaking czech ( though a couple of people felt it was polish ) . i ' ve seen one ad since then which i ' m pretty sure is in greek ( people on a fishing boat ) , because one of the subtitles contains mention of drachmas . if i ' m wrong about that , i 'd like to know , needless to say . those of you who expressed interest in seeing some of our research , i have n't forgotten you ! i ' ve just been buried in administrative stuff lately . i ' ll try to do something about getting it off over spring break , which is in a couple of weeks . if you do n't see something in the next few weeks , you might want to drop me another line at renryder @ idbsu . idbsu . edu . finally , very hearfelt thanks to everyone who wrote ( i hope i have n't left anyone off this list ) : eva wyss , daniel keller , marc picard , laila lalami , john koontz , dana slancova , gary h . toops , marlene abrams miller , guerssel mohamed , frits stuurman , chris miller , greenman , younes mourchid , tim beasley , james kirchner , paul woods , jussi karlgren , marc eisinger , michael kac , rebecca larche moreton , carl woolhiser , anton sherwood , elabbas benmamoun , karin ryding , elizabeth bergman , kirk belnap ( ? ) , reinier post . if anyone wants the addresses of any of these people to discuss the language id with them further , i have them ; i just did n't want to make this message any longer than necessary . thanks to everyone ! mary ellen ryder 	0

Subject: aaas  what follows are the minutes of the meeting of section z - linguistics and the language science - - held during the atlanta aaas annual meeting . the section committee hopes that this will be of interest to all linguists and once again urges any linguist not yet a member of aaas to join and select section z as their priary affiliation . ( a membership form follows the minutes ) v . fromkin , section z , secretary = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = section z - - linguistics & the language sciences section meeting - february 17 , 1995 , 2 : 30 - 5 : 30 pm marriott marquis , atlanta , ga . minutes attendance : retiring chair barbara lust , chair , richie kayne , chair - elect stephen anderson , chair elect 1995 sarah thomason , secretary , vicki fromkin , members of steering committee : paul chapin , ilse lehiste , paul chapin , section z representative to aaas council , arnold zwicky , and 10-25 individuals ( 20 signed the attendance sheet ) . ( 1 ) the meeting was called to order and chaired by chair richie kayne . the attendees were asked to introduce themselves . ( 2 ) the minutes of the feb . 21 , 1993 section meeting were distributed and approved . ( 3 ) the results of the last election were reported : sarah ( sally ) thomason was elected chair - elect for 1995 , and david caplan was elected member at large 1995 - 1998 . the members of the steering committee for 1995 ( as of february 21 , 1995 ) therefore consist of : retiring chair richie kayne , chair stephen anderson , chair elect sarah thomason , secretary victoria a . fromkin , members - at - large : david caplan , paul chapin , ilse lehiste . arnold zwicky remains as the council delegate through 1996 . the chair expressed the appreciation of all members of section z to retiring chair barbara lust ( who will serve on the council in 1995 ) and david pesetsky . ( 4 ) four sessions were sponsored by section z at this meeting : bilingualism : when is the best age to learn a second language ? ; endangered languages ; linguistic science and language technology : machines and human language ; structures of language : batons for cognitive science and neuroscience . in addition , section z cosponsored a session organized by the psychology section : instincts to learn . kenneth hale presented one of the topical lectures - - the scientific cost of the global loss of linguistic diversity . ken hale s lecture and the session on endangered languages received a great deal of interest from the press . ( this issue made national press coverage by the time of the section meeting , ) the section extended its gratitude to the session organizers and speakers , and to ken hale for their efforts in bringing linguistics to the general scientific community at the aaas . ( 5 ) dr . susan speece , chair of the department of biological sciences at anderson university , anderson in , who has been appointed as education liaison from the education section to section z was introduced . she distributed copies of life science standards and curriculum development for k-12 and reported on the work of the science education reform committee of the national research council and asked for suggestions and input from our section regarding science education k-12 and also undergraduate science education . , a discussion followed in which it was announced that stephen crain is heading a committee of the linguistic society of american on linguistics in the curriculum which is also concerned with the teaching of linguistic science in the schools . it was suggested that crain be asked to contact dr . speece . individuals were urged to view the poster paper linguistics in the schools : developing an epistemology of science by maya honda and wayne o neil on display from 10 : 30 to 3 : 30 on saturday , february 18 , in the marriott south exhibit hall . this poster paper is directly related to the subject under discussion . ( 6 ) budget . vicki fromkin reported on the budget situation . up to this meeting , section z received $ 2500 / annum from the aaas office which was supposed to cover the travel expenses of the section officers for the annual meeting , refreshments , and any expenses of the ssponsored sessions ( organizers and speakers ) that could be provided . last year we offered no support to symposia speakers . thus , this year after subtracting the probable expenses of the officers , the section budget total came to approximately $ 2500 . symposia organizers sent their requests to vicki fromkin . after she determined the cheapest possible fares of the speakers , she divided the sum so that no speaker who had requested funds would suffer financially more than the others and recommended to the aaas staff that these sums be disbursed . this leaves the section with a zero balance . at the planning committee which she attended , vicki reported that the staff had decided to change the section budgets . the expenses of the officers would no longer be deducted from the section allocation but would be borne by the central office . however , the sections would now receive much lower allocations ; section z will only receive $ 1000 / annum . it is urgent that symposia organizers inform their invited speakers that there is little if any money for expenses and speakers should attempt to find money elsewhere . ( 7 ) 1996 aaas annual meeting , baltimore , maryland , 8-13 february 1996 . proposals for sessions are due april 1 , 1995 . a general discussion was held regarding sessions to be sponsored by section z . the section agreed that it would like to see the following session organized . ( note that these are not necessarily the titles of the symposia to be submitted but rather signify the contents we would like to see presented . ) ( the name in parenthesis after each is the person designated to contact the proposed organizers ) i . language in the schools . proposed organizers wayne o neil , maya honda , walt wolfram ( wayne o neil ) ii . new technology ( e . g . mri , ct , pet ) in the study of the biology of language . proposed organizer : david caplan ( v . fromkin ) iii . the structure and acquisition of sign languages . proposed organizer : ursula bellugi ( v . fromkin ) iv . child language acquisition . proposed organizer : lila gleitman ( v . fromkin ) v : connectionism vs . symbolic systems models of cognition . proposed organizer : paul smolensky ( steve anderson ) ( following the meeting some of the members of the section steering committee proposed that geoffrey nunberg also be asked to submit a proposal on prescriptivism / the equality of dialects / english only legislation or such related issues . fromkin and anderson will contact him ) barbara lust informed the section that we also received a tentative idea for a possible symposium from lisa menn ( working with both lsa and asha ) which would be on theoretical , modeling and therapeutic studies of the acquisition of phonology . this was referred to sharon goldsmith of asha for further consideration for their support . ( 8 ) 1997 aaas annual meeting , seattle , washington . an opening discussion on possible sessions for the seattle meeting was held it was suggested that individuals should submit proposals to the nsf to fund sessions on reports of current research which would be of interest to the scientific community . such proposals should be submitted to paul chapin by no later than july 15 , 1995 in order to have a funding decision from nsf by december 1995 , in time to submit a session proposal to the aaas program committee . ( 9 ) membership . as of the time of the meeting , 169 members of aaas had selected section z as their primary affiliation , and according to mike spinella ( aaas staff , who attended the meeting briefly ) , 141 had designated section z as their secondary affiliation and 205 as their third . this total of 515 satisfies the aaas requirements for establishing section z as a permanent section of the aaas . in the words of mike spinella you re in ! . however , it is important that we continue to increase the members whose first affiliation is to our section . we would like to see that number grow to a minimum of 400 . in the discussion on methods to increase membership it was suggested that we ask the lsa if we can include a letter from the section chair and secretary in the regular mailings to linguistic department chairs asking if each department would subsidize the membership fee for one member ( probably the chair ) of the department . if the chair is already a member , another person should be designated , who could be elected by the faculty or determined in some other way . this would substantially increase our membership . sharon goldsmith from asha announced that she would be willing to place a notice in the asha newsletters and publications which go to 80 , 000 of their members . paul chapin agreed to draft a letter to send to asha for this purpose . it was also suggested that a membership form be included in the mailings . she also thanked section z for their support of the symposium on bilingualism which was organized by asha and introduced david kean , of the asha research and tehcnology committee . . barbara lust suggested that we contact all the international organizations such as lagb who supported the formation of the new section and ask them to publicize the section and urge their members to join . the question of the cost of joining aaas was discussed . there was confusion as to the cost of joining as a supporting member ( without receiving science ) particularly for foreign applicants . mike spinella assured us that supporting memberships cost $ 35 . 00 for us , and all non - us members . on the application form this $ 35 . fee is stated only for spouses of members , but we were assured that it is for anyone who joins as a supporting member . ( 10 ) endangered languages . michael strauss spoke on the importance of our establishing ties with non-linguists concerned with conservation and diversity , i . e . conservation biology , etc . david harmon of the george wright society of the world parks congress was introduced and told the group that until recently he did not realize the extent of the problem re maintaining linguistic diversity and the dangers facing endangered languages . he supported the suggestion that linguists concerned with this issue work together with other groups interested in cultural and biological diversity and endangered species . ( 11 ) at the 1994 meeting , it was agreed that it was important for linguists to submit research articles to science . this was reiterated . it was pointed out that one cannot complain about the contents of the journal and the heavy weighting toward biology if we do not submit articles . should they consistently be rejected we would then have grounds for complaint . ( 12 ) vicki fromkin announced that the international congress of linguists ( organized by the permanent international committee of linguistics , better known by its french initials cipl ) would be held in paris , in july of 1997 . ( 13 ) michael strauss , the director of annual meetings on the aaas staff and estrella m . triana , the senior program associate , aaas directorate for education & human resources programs were introduced . estrella triana announced that 1998 was the 150th anniversary of aaas and urged members to support the issuing of a aaas commemorative stamp . she also announced the fund raising drive for a new building , and reminded members that sections of the aaas were entitled to hold meetings in the aaas building in washington , dc . the meeting was adjourned submitted by v . fromkin , secretary section z = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = membership request form mail to : aaas - po box 2033 marion oh 43306-2133 or fax to ( 202 ) 842 1065 name _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ state _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ zip _ _ _ _ _ _ _ membership category : ( includes 51 issues of science ) * regular member $ 97 * postdoctoral $ 72 ( payment required with order , ) * student $ 50 ( payment & student id required ) supporting member $ 35 ( does not include science ) check enclosed _ _ _ bill me later _ _ _ ( regular members ) visa _ _ _ _ master card _ _ _ _ credit card number _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ exp date section z primary affiliation : _ _ _ _ ( check here ) * all include 51 issues of science . 	0

"Subject: referencing example numbers in wp  since the question has been raised about how to reference example numbers in wordperfect for dos , here 's my two-cents ' worth about wp5 . 1 and wp6 for dos . in 5 . 1 , although one could use paragraph numbers , as was suggested , this precludes using them to number sections of a paper . a better approach is to use the numbering facilities for "" graphics boxes . "" like paragraph numbers , graphics boxes can be referenced by the cross-reference feature in wp . what you have to do is set equation box options so that the caption is to the left of the box ( the default is to the right ) . for phonological rules , which can be nicely formatted using the equation editor , you then create an equation box with a caption consisting of "" ( [ box number ] ) "" and go into the equation editor to write the rule . for sample sentences , etc . , the box itself is empty , but with a caption as before , and set to allow text to overlap it . you can then exit the create graphics box screen and proceed to type the examples . the numbers automatically update as new boxes are added . cross - referencing is done by assigning name to any example you want to reference ( as a cross-reference target ) and then putting in a cross-reference reference code with the target 's name . you have to generate occasionally to update the reference numbers ; they initially appear as ? . in wp6 ( which is superior for linguistics because of its support for phonetic symbols ) it 's even easier . wp6 has a counters feature ( in the character format dialog box ) . you define a counter ( i call mine example ) . whenever you want to insert an example , you type ( in the main document screen ) the open parenthesis , go into the counters dialog box , and push f8 ( or click on the increment and display button ) . this inserts two codes : one to increment the number ( this is not done automatically for user-defined counters ) and one to display it . cross - referencing is done as before . a couple of additional wp tips : - the styles feature is very useful for dealing with in-text stylesheets for journals . for any feature where journals have different styles ( scare quotes , sentence glosses and translations , in-text reference punctuation , etc . ) you assign a style . styles can be any combination of characters and codes . for each journal , you create a different style library . then , if you want to change formatting from one to another , you simply read in a different style library . - the above is too simple for bibliography style sheets , where the order of elements differs in addition to punctuation and font attribute . if you are comfortable with programming , you can write merge programs ( called primary merge files in wp5 . 1 and merge form files in wp6 ) for the different stylesheets and have a bibliography file which is formatted as a secondary merge file ( wp5 . 1 ) / merge data file ( wp6 ) , with fields for things like author 's first and last names , year , title , etc . ( include a field for type of reference ( book , article , dissertation , etc . ) since the format of the title may vary . ) this is not recommended for computerphobes , however . - lining up foreign language examples with word-for - word glosses in proportional fonts can be done using tabs , and resetting the tab stops for each example . this is easier from wp6 . 0b onwards ( if you have a mouse ) because of the ruler feature : you display the ruler and drag the tab stops , and as you drag them a dotted line extends down from the tab stop through the text so you can see exactly where you are . in previous versions , you have to go into the tab set menu and play with the tab settings by trial and error . it is even possible to put asterisks inside the space of the tab between the example number and the example . instead of tabbing , use the tab align ( wp5 . 1 ) or decimal align ( wp6 ) feature ( ctrl f6 ) . before pressing ctrl - f6 , set the "" decimal character "" to the first letter of the example ( on the other format menu in 5 . 1 and the character format menu in 6 ) . to prevent the spell-checker from stopping on words in foreign examples ( or phonetic representations , or logical formulae ) , in 5 . 1 you can use the language feature to insert a made-up language code . the spell-checker will complain that it can't find the dictionary for the language , and you tell it to ignore the language and continue checking what it can . in wp6 a block can be marked [ speller / grammatik off ] ( on the other format menu ) to prevent it from being spell - or grammar-checked . - - yehuda n . falk department of english the hebrew university of jerusalem "" live long and prosper "" - vulcan greeting "	0
"Subject: ipa vs americanist symbols  i am at last drawn to reply to the debate on ipa versus ' americanist ' traditions in phonetic transcription . i was , frankly , somewhat surprised by the tone of the original submission , suggesting that the ipa 's refusal to use hachek / wedge symbols for palatoalveolars was an example of racism ( both anti - americanism and anti-slavicism , and no doubt anti - diacriticism ) . now we learn that the ipa itself is an anti-democratic conspiracy , and we need a new campaign led by american organisations to make phonetic transcription 's afe for democracy , apple pie , and the american way ' ! ? a couple of points need to made in this regard , i think . first , it is not true that the ipa is not used in north america . what we have here is maybe not euro - centrism , but phonology / dialectology centrism ! clinical phoneticians and speech pathologists in north american nearly always use the ipa ( yes : long esses / zees , jods , and the cardinal vowel system , and all ! ) indeed , some departments of linguistics / phonetics operate within the ipa tradition ( e . g . university of victoria bc ) . on the other hand , virtually all phonologists on this side of the atlantic use the so-called americanist symbols . the divide , therefore , is not as has been portrayed . if phonologists tend to use one set of symbols , and phoneticians another , is that really such a problem , as often they are concerned with different levels of description anyway ? even if phoneticians cannot agree , is this also such a problem ? can raising the fears of racial discrimination and undemocratic conspiracies really be justified over relatively trivial distinctions in symbols that anyone trained in the area knows about anyway ? the second point concerns the debate on the symbols themselves . as i have just noted , the difference between certain symbols is surely not a fundamentally important one ; but i would like to speak in defence of the ipa non-hachek versions . leaving aside the fact that these symbols do have a long history , i ( do ) feel that a unit symbol is preferably than a composite one . ( unlike the original posting , it always seemed obvious to me that the hachek symbols were s / z etc plus a diacritic ) . granted that the ipa is not always consistent on this point , a unitary symbol approach avoids confusions as to the nature of the s - s distinction . one may have to counter students ' feelings that [ s ] is really only a type of [ s ] which is reinforced by the spelling ; it does n't help if the symbol looks also like a 's ort of s ' . we might also look at the difference with [ j ] versus [ y ] for the palatal approximant . on the surface , this looks fine , as the [ y ] spelling is familiar ( but surely anglocentric , and not in line with slavic / germanic etc usage ? ) . however , this choice then leaves us with a problem for a high front rounded vowel . if we can't use [ y ] then we must resort to [ u "" ] . the diacritic [ "" ] , however , is also commonly used in many traditions to stand for centralized . this transcription also suggests that [ u "" ] is a variety of [ u ] , and that [ o "" ] is a variety of [ o ] etc . the use of independent symbols leaves open the relationship between lip-rounding and tongue position , which the 'd iaresis ' versions do not . however phonetic transcription develops in the future , let 's avoid throwing around accusations at other users or bodies . utopian schemes of universal orthodoxy in this area are surely unneccessary if not unsound . to be realistic , most ipa users ( wherever they ' re based ) are unlikely to surrender over a century 's worth of patterns of usage , and non - ipa users will be equally keen to keep to their symbolizations . let 's learn to live with this , and spend instead time on refining transcription systems ( e . g . for the transcription of atypical speech found in speech pathology clinics ) . perhaps , vive la difference is the motto to aspire to ! martin j . ball university of ulster "	0

"Subject: sum . : history of capitalisation in english  back in late january / early february i posted a query to linguist about sources on the history of capitalisation in english . several people responded asking me to post a summary to the list on any replies i might receive . my apologies for the delay , but i have been fighting three different winter "" bugs "" ( some viral , some bacterial ) since my original posting , and then had to rush to catch up on acadaemic commitments before the end of term ! anyway , here is the summary . . . . the most immediate "" success "" reply , so to speak , came from david denison at u . of manchester , u . k . : mrcepdd @ fsl . art . man . ac . uk . david suggested the following article : osselton , noel ( 1985 ) ' spelling - book rules and the capitalization of nouns in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ' . in arn , mary - jo and hanneke wirtjes ( eds . ) . * * historical and editorial studies in medieval and modern english : for johan gerritsen . * * wolters - noordhoff , groningen , pp . 49-61 . to my delight , i found that "" my "" university library ( knight lib . at the u . of oregon ) had precisely this volume . the article ( chapter ) is only 6 pages long , but contains as well a list of spelling books and grammars , etc . to which osselton referred in the text . there is also a page of notes . this reference is the most useful i have yet seen , and i will be using it ( when i have the time ) as a foundation for finding more info . on this topic . a good place to start , i think . a reply from john e . koontz ( koontz @ bldr . nist . gov ) pointed me towards usenet lists which , i regret , i have not yet been able to try . john suggests comp . fonts , or hte repositories of past usenet postings ( he is not sure where they are ) , or the usenet faq collections . also , comp . text . larry rosenwald ( lrosenwald @ wellesley . edu ) suggested looking into the literature of printing history , as he reminded me that "" in fact capitalization was often regularized by the printer . "" henry rogers ( rogers @ epas . utoronto . ca ) wrote and remarked that "" [ t ] he distinction between upper and lower case in the roman alphabet obviously developed in the writing of the middle ages . . .

( and as a final parting shot , so to speak , i would like to point out that in english writing we use a capital letter for the 1st . p . s . in all environments , but not for any other person ! why ? was this a printing influence too ( e . g . , to distinguish it from small "" i "" in roman numerals ? ) . ) from talking to a local professor , russian , for instance , ( if i remember correctly ) , does not have this distinction . how about other language writing systems , european or not ? and what effect does this english pattern have on us psychologically ? in the sense that "" i "" is more important than "" you , them "" etc . ? ) . once again , thank-you to all respondents . i look forward to discussion , if any , on my questions - - either post to list or to me directly . regards to all , anthea . * * "" words do n't mean , people mean . . . .

"Subject: est-ce que questions  several weeks ago , i ' ve sent an inquiry about is it that / est-ce que interrogatives to the list . many of you took the time to answer to it , so i feel very sorry for not giving any summary of the replies before today . i have written one in french , which i display here . if some of you would like a translation , please ask and i ' ll write one . thanks again for your precious collaboration ! the inquiry was : j ' ai rencontre l ' enonce authentique suivant : why is it that ( people are never happy ) ? qui ressemble beaucoup au fran ais : pourquoi est-ce que ( les gens ne sont jamais contents ) ? j ' aimerais savoir s ' il est possible de poser une question de la meme maniere avec : what , who , when , where or how ? what is it that you said / are saying ? who is it that you met / are meeting ? when is it that you met / are meeting her ? how is it that you did / do this ? where is it that you were / are ? sur les 54 reponses obtenues , 21 consistent en une phrase : "" tous ces exemples me paraissent acceptables et normaux "" . les auteurs des autres reponses ont tres majoritairement accepte tous les exemples egalement , mais avec quelques restrictions d ' emploi que nous developpons ici . les quatre grands types de restrictions sont le registre de langue employe , la semantique de l ' interrogative , la nature de l ' adverbe interrogatif et le temps du verbe etre place avant ' it that ' . 1 . le registre employe est juge pertinent pour l ' acceptabilite de la structure , comme le montrent les six remarques suivantes : "" alors que les phrases proposees seraient appropriees dans un registre tres formel , des equivalents plus courants [ colloquial ] seraient : you said / are saying whatj ? you met / are meeting whoj ? you met / are meeting her whenj ? you did / do this howj ? you were / are where j ? cet equivalent ' courant ' n ' existe pas cependant avec why . je dirais plutot : people never seem to be happy . why ( is that ) j ? "" "" why is it that convient mais ne semble pas tres naturel ; l ' emploi de ' that ' marque un registre plus formel . "" "" les exemples semblent appropries dans tous les registres , peut-etre un peu moins frequents dans un ecrit tres formel . "" "" toutes ces questions sont parfaitement ordinaires . "" "" j ' attribue ces phrases au registre courant [ colloquial ] plutot que litteraire . "" "" je dirais que ces phrases seraient acceptees par n ' importe quel locuteur americanophone , au moins dans une conversation informelle . "" les commentaires divergent , certains locuteurs attribuant les exemples a un registre formel , d ' autres a un registre non formel . la premiere personne optant pour le registre formel precise que ce type d ' enonce est caracteristique d ' une question que poserait par exemple un avocat au cours d ' un proces ; mais c ' est peut-etre plutot la semantique de la question qui importe ici , et non le registre . la deuxieme personne ayant choisi le registre formel semble cependant s ' appuyer surtout sur la presence de that . en effet , une autre reponse souligne la difference existant entre les formes ' why is it ' et ' why is it that ' . par consequent nous pouvons retenir des commentaires obtenus que la construction qui nous interesse releve globalement d ' un registre courant - voire familier - mais peut se retrouver dans d ' autres registres sous certaines formes ( avec that vs sans that ) et pour exprimer certains actes de parole . 2 . la semantique de l ' interrogative intervient elle aussi dans le choix de cette construction , comme l ' attestent les 13 remarques suivantes : "" par rapport a la construction plus traditionnelle , celle-ci se limite aux cas ou le locuteur exprime une repetition ou une clarification apres avoir pose la question sous la forme plus courante : me : what did you sayj ? you : i said "" goodbye and good riddancej ! "" me : what is it that you saidj ? i was n't listening closely . "" "" cette construction marquee n ' est appropriee que si le discours precedent a deja etabli qu ' il y aura une reponse non negative a la question . ainsi , l ' echange suivant ne semblerait pas naturel : - who is it that you sawj ? - nobody . "" "" je n ' accepterais pas ou reagirais negativement a la phrase how is it that you did thatj ? . j ' emploie cette construction avec tous les autres adverbes ( where , who , what , when ) pour obtenir un eclaircissement a propos d ' une chose deja mentionnee . "" "" les exemples me semblent normaux si le locuteur met l ' accent sur l ' adverbe interrogatif et exprime une certaine exasperation : what is that thing you boughtj ? "" "" ces questions sont tout a fait acceptables , moyennant un contexte discursif particulier du type reprise . d ' ou la meilleure acceptabilite des versions dans lesquelles le verbe est marque de l ' aspect be + ing ( fondamentalement anaphorique ) . "" "" cette construction met l ' emphase sur l ' element interrogatif . "" "" spontanement , je dirais que cette construction se focalise sur la question plus specifiquement . si l ' on me demandait : who are you meetingj ? je pourrais repondre : a friend . mais si la question etait : who is it that you ' re meetingj ? je me sentirais oblige de repondre plus precisement . "" "" la seule raison justifiant l ' emploi de cette construction est , a mon avis , l ' emphase qu ' elle met sur l ' objet de la question . "" "" en anglais , ces questions sont posees de fa on rhetorique ou pour exprimer une demande de clarification . dans le deuxieme cas , l ' element interrogatif est fortement accentue . "" "" la plupart de ces questions ressemblent a une demande de repetition de quelque chose qui aurait ete mal compris a la premiere audition . "" "" les questions de ce type correspondent a la forme declarative emphatique it is because of x that ou it is x that i am saying ( . . . ) . ces questions en anglais se traduiraient mieux en fran ais par quelque chose comme : qui c ' est que tu as vuj ? qui met aussi l ' accent sur la reponse la ou une question en est-ce que normale ne le ferait pas . cette construction entra ne aussi une accentuation plus forte sur l ' element interrogatif . "" "" dans beaucoup de cas , ces formes marqueraient une emphase utilisee par exemple si je pensais avoir mal compris un message : where is it that you [ said you ] arej ? "" "" pour moi , ces constructions presupposent que quelqu ' un vous a donne l ' information ( what , who , when ou where ) et que vous l ' avez oubliee et devez poser une question sur ce seul element . "" toutes ces remarques s ' accordent pour attribuer a la construction qui nous interesse un sens emphatique utilise pour obtenir une clarification . elle semble aussi s ' accompagner d ' une accentuation de l ' element interrogatif . il est donc interessant de remarquer que la valeur emphatique est commune aux constructions anglaise et fran aise . 3 . parmi les 54 reponses , 11 tentaient d ' expliquer partiellement ou completement la variation de l ' acceptabilite de la construction en fonction de la nature de l ' adverbe interrogatif : "" where is it that you arej ? et how is it that you do thisj ? sont pour moi les constructions les plus maladroites et les moins frequentes . "" "" where is it that you arej ? est maladroit ; je repeterais probablement la question where are youj ? en accentuant plus le where . "" "" je ne pense pas que le that dans why is it that soit le meme que dans les constructions avec les adverbes interrogatifs . "" "" why is it et how is it sont toujours idiomatiques , meme s ' ils sont plutot formels . when is it est idiomatique , mais para t assez pauvre . les autres enonces identifieraient a coup sur le locuteur comme etant etranger . "" "" toutes ces constructions sont possibles , excepte celle avec how . "" "" pour what , who , when et where , je peux employer is it seulement avec le present ; avec le passe je dirais was it . pour how c ' est different parce que how is it est une forme idiomatique signifiant pourquoi pour moi . donc how is it that you did thisj ? convient si cela signifie pourquoi as-tu fait celaj ? . si je veux vraiment savoir comment , alors le temps doit correspondre comme avec les autres adverbes interrogatifs . "" "" les constructions avec what , who et when sont acceptables , mais celles avec how et where ne semblent pas tres naturelles . "" "" toutes les constructions me conviennent ( sauf peut-etre la derniere avec where , qui me para t bizarre ) . "" "" je pense qu ' il ne serait pas approprie d ' employer is it that dans aucune des situations mentionnees , excepte why is it that . . "" "" j ' utiliserais cette construction avec when seulement s ' il etait suivi de was it ; je ne l ' emploierais pas avec how et where . "" "" tous les exemples cites sont acceptables mais , mise a part la question avec why ( et peut-etre celle avec how ) , ils ne semblent pas aussi generaux que la question ordinaire [ unmarked ] . "" pour des raisons qui leur sont probablement propres , why , how et where se distinguent des autres adverbes . how is it peut s ' interpreter a la fois comme une forme figee qui a le sens de pourquoi ( = how come ) , et comme une construction non figee signifiant comment . . cela explique les differences de perception de cette forme par les locuteurs , qui n ' ont pas toujours pris en compte ses deux sens . why is it a egalement un comportement de forme figee , mais qui garde le sens de pourquoi . pourquoi est aussi un adverbe qui se demarque des autres en fran ais , car la question qu ' il pose porte sur l ' ensemble de la phrase ( pourquoi tu t ' en vasj ? mais * tu t ' en vas pourquoij ? ) . nous expliquons moins facilement la specificite de where qui a ete relevee a 5 reprises . 4 . le dernier facteur d ' acceptabilite egalement souvent cite ( huit fois ) par les natifs est le temps du verbe etre place avant it that . : "" toutes ces phrases s ' emploient couramment en anglais . a noter qu ' on peut aussi bien utiliser ce genre de structure au passe : where was it that you ran into him yesterdayj ? "" "" nous formons souvent des enonces come ceux que vous citez , par exemple : who was it who split ink on your book ? why was it that he was late ? who did we say was coming at 8 o ' clock ? etc . "" "" pour what , who , when et where , je peux employer is it seulement avec le present ; avec le passe je dirais was it . [ pour ] how is it that you did thisj ? , et si je veux vraiment savoir comment , alors le temps doit correspondre comme avec les autres adverbes interrogatifs . "" "" toutes les phrases me conviennent , meme si dans plusieurs cas j ' ai pense qu ' il y avait une meilleure alternative : what is it that you said / are saying ? ) aussi : what was it that you said ? who is it that you met / are meeting ? ) aussi : who was it that you met ? when is it that you met / are meeting her ? ) avec "" met "" , "" when was it that you met "" est meilleur . how is it that you did / do this ? ) aussi : how was it that you did that ? where is it that you were / are ? ) avec "" were "" , "" where was it that you were "" est meilleur . "" "" toutes les phrases sont bonnes . elles seraient un peu meilleures si les temps des verbes s ' accordaient . "" "" les questions conviennent toutes , tant que le temps employe est correct . "" "" quand l ' anglais emploie l ' expression is it that , les temps des verbes doivent correspondre dans la plupart des cas . "" "" toutes les phrases sont parfaitement correctes , sauf que normalement j ' accorderais le temps du premier verbe a celui du second lorsque deuxieme la portion de la phrase est au passe . par exemple : who was it that you met ? ( but ) who is it that you are meeting ? when was it that you met her ? ( but ) when is it that you are meeting her ? . "" nous pouvons sur ce point differencier les constructions ' is it that ' et ' est-ce que ' , la construction de l ' anglais etant beaucoup moins figee que celle du fran ais . en effet , le fran ais n ' accorderait pas les temps des deux verbes .

( 2 ) computational models and ( 3 ) symbol grounding . the target audience of this colloquium will include engineers and scientists in neural networks and artificial intelligence , developmental psychologists , cognitive scientists , philosophers of mind , biologists and all of those interested in the application of artificial intelligence to real world problems . programme : monday , may 15th , 1995 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * introduction : 9 . 00 registration + sustenance 10 . 00 ` an introduction ' noel sharkey ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) biology : 10 . 30 ` the neuronal mechanisms of language ' valentino braitenberg ( max plank institute for biological cybernetics , tuebingen , germany ) computational models : 11 . 00 ` natural language and exploration of an information space ' oliviero stock ( istituto per la ricerca scientifica e technologica , irst ) ( trento , italy ) 11 . 30 ` how visual salience influences natural language descriptions ' wolfgang maass ( cognitive science programme ) ( universitaet des saarlandes , saarbruecken , germany ) 12 . 00 discussion 12 . 30 lunch grounding symbols : 2 . 00 ` on grounding language with neural networks ' georg dorffner ( austrian institute for artificial intelligence , vienna , austria ) 2 . 30 ` some observations on symbol-grounding from a combined symbolic / connectionist viewpoint ' john barnden ( computing research laboratory , new mexico , usa ) & ( department of computer science , university of reading , england ) 3 . 00 sustenance break 3 . 30 ` grounding symbols in sensorimotor categories with neural networks ' stevan harnad ( department of psychology , university of southampton , england ) panel discussion and questions : 4 . 00 ` grounding representations ' chairs + invited speakers s / in s / in : 4 . 30 ` de brief / comments ' paul mc kevitt ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) 5 . 00 o / iche mha / ith * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * publication : we intend to publish a book on this colloquium proceedings . addresses iee contact : sarah leong groups officer the institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . e - mail : sleong @ iee . org . uk ( sarah leong ) e - mail : mbarrett @ iee . org . uk ( martin barrett ) e - mail : dpenrose @ iee . org . uk ( david penrose ) www : http : / / www . iee . org . uk ftp : ftp . iee . org . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-497 - 3633 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-240 - 1871 ( general ) phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-344 - 8423 ( direct ) location : the institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . academic contact : paul mc kevitt department of computer science regent court 211 portobello street university of sheffield gb - s1 4dp , sheffield england , uk , eu . e - mail : p . mckevitt @ dcs . shef . ac . uk www : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / www : http : / / www . shef . ac . uk / ftp : ftp . dcs . shef . ac . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-278 - 0972 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-282 - 5572 ( office ) 282-5596 ( lab . ) 282-5590 ( secretary ) registration : registration forms are available from sarah leong at the above address and should be sent to the following address : ( it is not possible to register by e - mail . ) colloquium bookings institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) po box 96 stevenage gb - sg1 2sd herts england , uk , eu . fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 874 2792 receipt enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 876 7243 registration enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 171 240 1871 x . 2206 pre-registration is advised although you can register on the day of the event . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ r e g i s t r a t i o n costs _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( all figures include vat ) iee members 44 . 00 non-iee members 74 . 00 iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) free non-iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) 22 . 00 lunch ticket 4 . 70 members : members of the ieeie , the british computer society and the society for the study of artificial intelligence and simulation of behaviour and eurel member associations will be admitted at members ' rates .

"Subject: 200  summary on reduplication a month before christmas ( in linguist vol-5 - 1354 ) i sent out a query about * reduplication * and how this strategy is grammaticalized in languages to convey some facet of * intensification * . this is a summary based on the 45 replies i received from linguist netters . allow me to thank you all collectively now , since i will not be referring to single respondents in the following discussion . the topic of reduplication interests me because i am writing on my phd on repetition with respect to intensification and iconicity in swedish . the point of departure in the original query were the claims found in lakoff & johnson ( metaphors we live by ; 1980 ) according to which reduplication may indicate : - plural or collective - intensification or increase - continuation or completion - diminution thus , ' more ' of physical linguistic ' form ' corresponds to ' more ' in the ' content ' of the reduplicated expression as opposed to a non-reduplicated form - - as an instance of diagrammatic iconicity ( or as a realization of the * conduit * metaphor in the terms of lakoff & johnson ) . there are reflections of the outlined principles in colloquial english in expressions like ' an old old man ' , ' the music got louder and louder ' , 's he talks talks talks ' , ' the ball bounced and bounced ' , ' there 's forms forms forms forms ' , ' it was sinking down down ' , etc . i originally mentioned , however , that these structures were * marked * in a language like english . the choice of words was perhaps not so lucky . what i meant by "" marked "" is that even if we may think that such expressions are frequent in casual speech , they are rare in more constrained contexts . a less marked way of intensifying would probably be to use a specific intensifier or quantifier , e . g . ' a very old man ' , ' talks a lot ' . i hope no one will be offended by this simplistic analysis , it is only leading us a bit beside the point . ( for a comprehensive account on "" repetition in english "" , see persson 1974 , univ . of uppsala , sw . ) i was in my query more after pointers to and examples of languages where reduplication as a means of * intensification * is an integrated , so to speak , a standard characteristic of the grammar . this was also , more or less , what i got . i will summarize the outcome in the following ; i am aware of that in most instances the "" facts "" are probably subject to qualification , but for the sake of clarity & brevity i will lay the examples ahead in a rather list-like manner . furthermore , the examples certainly represent only a sample of the languages in the world that have incorporated reduplication in their system . note that i have left out - - in order to make it all more illustrative - - possible tone marks and diacritics of the transliteration . 1 . plural or collective * in malay / bahasa ( indonesia ) , full word reduplication turns singular to plural : anak ' child ' anak-anak ' children ' * in nahuatl ( or "" aztec "" ) , prefixed reduplication with nouns conveys a plural meaning : cih-tli ' hare ' ( where ' cih - ' is the stem ) ci : cih-tli pl . - - moreover , there are no structurally distinct adjectives in nahuatl but certain "" adjectival "" suffixes that can take on a plural notion via reduplication : - pi : l diminutive suffix - pipi : l plural * hausa is cited to have reduplication in the formation of plurals of a limited set of nouns . * in japanese , reduplication may turn a noun to a collective , but the scope of this strategy is said to be marginal : hito ' person ' hitobito ' people ' kami ' god ' kamigami ' gods ' * in mandarin ( chinese ) , reduplication turns singular to collective ( but this is said to be rare ) : ren ' person ' renren ' people ' - - moreover , both in mandarin and cantonese * classifier * items may be reduplicated to convey "" universal quantification "" in contrast to more unique reference . this fits readily in the notion of intensification ( or augmentation ) : ge ren ' a person ' ( mandarin ) ge ge ren ' every person ' douh ' place , there ' ( cantonese ) douh-douh ' everywhere ' * dakotan patterns plurals of stative intransitive verbs with reduplication . this is said only to apply to instances with inanimate subjects though . north american languages in general may be of interest when considering reduplication but i am short of examples at present . following languages were mentioned in the replies , though : klamath , nez perce , sahaptin . 2 . intensification or increase * mandarin chinese intensifies adjectives with reduplication : xiao 's mall ' xiaoxiao ' very small ' gaoxing ' happy ' gaogaoxingxing ' very happy ' as you notice , with disyllabic adjectives the reduplication pattern is aabb . - - cantonese also uses reduplication for augmentation or emphasis . * turkish is , apparently , a point in case . reduplication of adjectives indicates intensification or increase in the following way : temiz ' clean ' tertemiz ' very clean ' dolu ' full ' dopdolu ' very full ' bos ' empty ' bosbos ' completely empty ' here we have prefixed reduplication accompanied with a binding consonant . interestingly , there do not seem to be "" rules "" for which binding consonant should be inserted in a given case . * hausa is cited to use reduplication in the intensification of adjectives . * celtic languages have full word reduplication to indicate intensification . the method is reminiscent of the case of english , but it may be more "" integrated "" in the grammar of the celtic ( are there any opinions about this ? ) . could the celtic model have influenced germanic languages so that we still today have rather similar reduplication in the colloquial registers ( just my own modest idea . . . ) ? here are some examples provided by netters : - - welsh : ty bach bach ' a very small house ' oglau cryf cryf ' a very strong smell ' - - gaelic : fada fada ' very long ' trua trua ' very pity ' - - breton : braz-braz ' very tall ' this is said to be common especially in negative sentences . * in colloquial russian reduplication / repetition of adj 's / adv 's has likewise an intensifying function . the use is probably stylistically similar to repetition in colloquial english , but it is said to be limited to * predicate * adjectives : belyj-belyj ' very white ' tixo-tixo ' very quietly ' * it was also pointed that finnish has prefixed reduplication in some intensified adjectival forms . this is true , indeed , but - - what it seems - - wholly lexicalized and non-productive . in any case , here are some examples i and my colleague enjoyed coming up with : taysi ' full ' ( umlaut a ) tapo-taysi ' completely full ' ( uml . a 's & o ) tyhja ' empty ' ( uml . a ) typo-tyhja ' compl . empty ' ( uml . a 's & o ) puhdas ' clean ' puti-puhdas ' compl . clean ' uusi ' new ' upo-uusi ' brand new ' pinta 's urface ' piri-pinta ' right on the surface ' suomalainen ' finnish ' supi-suomalainen ' purely finnish ' yksin ' alone ' ypo-yksin ' compl . alone ' ( uml . o ) tiessaan ' lost ' ( uml . a 's ) tipo-tiessaan ' compl . lost ' ( uml . a 's & o ) the prefixed items ' tapo ' , ' typo ' , ' tipo ' , 's upi ' , ' puti ' , ' piri ' , ' upo ' , ' ypo ' do not seem to mean anything , at least for the speakers today . it seems that the first vowel or the pair first consonant & vowel of the stem are reduplicated with a binding syllable that most often has a ' p ' and a vowel , e . g . : ta-po - taysi , ty-po - tyhja , u-po - uusi , y-po - yksin could this have been productive in some earlier stage of the language ? * finally , in classical ( only ? ) greek a small number of * verbs * may have reduplication to communicate some sort of intensifying , expressive or affective notions : pam-phain - ei ' it shines brightly ' ( ( * phan-phan - j-ei ) 3 . continuation or completion reduplication is , evidently , often used in the formation of present , progressive or perfective . i take here the view that present or progressive forms combine with * continuation * , whereas perfective forms communicate * completion * . it was nice to discover that "" classical "" linguistic tradition can offer fitting data here . it feels appropriate to begin with these examples . - - - * in sanskrit , the perfect stem is formed by reduplication : budh - ' know ' bubodh - perf . jan - ' born ' jajan - perf . aorist ( ' true perfect ' ) roots may also be formed by a kind of reduplication : jan - ajijana - ( aor . ) in addition , present stems may be formed by reduplication : bhii - 'd rink ' bibhii - pres . * classical greek uses partial reduplication , i . e . prefixation of the initial consonant of a verb plus the vowel ' e ' , in stems for perfect tenses : le-lu - k-a ' i have freed ' pe-poie : - k-a ' i have made ' ge-grap - tai ' it has been written ' if the root begins with a vowel , the vowel is augmented . furthermore , some common verbs take reduplication in their * present * tense ; the initial consonant is reduplicated with the vowel ' i ' : di-do : - mi ' i give / am giving ' gi-gno - mai ' i am becoming ' ti-the : - mi ' i am placing ' ( ( * thi-the : - mi ) * in latin , perfect forms may involve reduplication : curro ' run ' cucurri perf . - - - let us then go over to more living languages . * in hausa , reduplication applied to verbs in two different ways expresses completion or continuity respectively . modified suffixed reduplication gives an idea of * completed * action : cika ' fill ' cikakke compl . jefa ' throw ' jefaffe compl . prefixed reduplication communicates "" something like continuity "" , as expressed by the respondent : buga ' beat ' bubbuga ' keep on beating ' kira ' call ' kikkira ' call various people ' * in tagalog ( philippines ) , reduplication distinguishes * imperfective * actions from perfective : bili root of ' buy ' bibili irrealis imperfective upo root of 's it ' uupo irr . imp . kuha root of ' get ' kukuha irr . imp . some scholars call irrealis perfective * completed * aspect and irrealis imperfective * contemplated * aspect . this makes sense , since irrealis imperfective ' bibili ' seems to translate to ' will buy ' . * in wailevu / fijian ( austronesia ) , reduplication is used in so called "" object defocusing "" that involves repetition of the action and a progressive marker : au xau-ta na agone ' i carry the child ' au xau-xau jixo ' i ' m carrying now ' au dola-va na xaatuba ' i open the window ' au dola-dola jixo ' i ' m opening now ' moreover , in this language adjectives may be derived from verbs through reduplication . even if noted to be "" not productive "" , the process is fascinating : sava-ta ' wash - tr ' sava-sava - a ' clean ' the adjective could be understood to represent * completed * action , the result , in a way very similar to how the perfect participle works in , say , germanic : she has washed the cloth . - - ) a washed cloth * in nahuatl ( "" aztec "" ) , reduplication may affect the meaning of a verb in several ways . - - an action carried out in a "" systematic "" ( progressive ? ) way : tequi base for ' to slice ' or ' to hack ' te : tequi 's lice / carve something ' cho : ca ' weep ' cho : cho : ca ' weep continuously ' - - of the same base verbs , an action carried out in a "" random "" ( involving repetition ? ) way : tehtequi ' hack something up ' chohcho : ca ' to sob ' - - furthermore , reduplication may be recursive ( e . g . of ' weep continuously ' & 's ob ' respectively ) : cho : cho : cho : ca chohchohcho : ca - - verbs with certain morphologic characteristic may take on reduplication to indicate * repeated action * : tzili : ni ' make a metallic sound ' tzttzilica ' jingle ' tzitzilitza ' make something jingle ' * in afrikaans , reduplication applied to some verbs seems give a progressive idea : hy loop eet-eet ' he eats continuously while walking ' 4 . diminution there are not many examples of * diminution * in the total of replies . in a sense , the process of "" making something smaller "" could possibly go under the more general strategy of * intensification or increase * ( although it is literally about "" decrease "" ) . nevertheless , there were a couple of possibly fitting cases : * cantonese may use reduplication to convey * diminution * or * moderation * . * it was pointed that english ( ! ) has some "" diminutive "" reduplication in formations like ' itsy-bitsy ' , ' eensie - weensie ' , ' teeny-tiny ' . these carry the content ' very small ' , but they belong merely to the child-speak register . in any case , the examples are diagnostic of the diminutive case . 5 . other there are uses of reduplication that go beyond the suggested four categories above . with some restraint , some of these could perhaps be seen as slight offsprings of the more general principle of marking * plurality * . i do not go into detailed examples but mention some most common semantic categories : - - distributive reduplication : presupposes two or more referents that are taken separately ( type : ' one by one ' ) - - reflexive notions go naturally hand in hand with distributive ( type : ' one another ' ) - - the so called * delimitative aspect * , i . e . 'd oing something for a while ' , in mandarin and cantonese does not at first seem to fit in * continuity * or * completion * . however , the semantics of the delimitative aspect is said to encompass "" implied repetition "" : tai-tai ' take a look at ' ( cant . ) chang-chang ' have a taste ' ( man . ) shi-shi ' have a go ' ( man . ) what would seem logical to me is that a casual , temporally short action like ' take a look ' reaches its termination quicker than standard ' looking ' . i do n't know if this kind of an implicit sense of "" rapid completion "" could be the motivation of this reduplication ? - - - then there are numerous instances of reduplication that communicate * contrastive emphasis * . these do not necessarily combine with the above functional categories at all . the motivation of such reduplication is merely to * make a point * clearer . the ( american ) english "" double "" is a seemingly nice example of this : shall we rent a car car , or would you rather have a jeep ? of course , emphasis is a sort of * intensification * and , thus , it touches the theme of our discussion . * * * * now i think it 's time to close this rather lengthy summary . thanks for reading it . if you would like to add something to the discussion - - like comment on my suggestions - - , feel free to e-mail ( or snailmail ) the "" stuff "" directly to me .

Subject:   syntax marcus maia . the comprehension of object anaphora in brazilian portuguese . usc . 1994 . distributed by gsil publications , usc . this thesis examines the comprehension of the empty category and the third person lexical pronoun in object position in brazilian portuguese ( bp ) . experimental results show that the processing of bp overt and nonovert objects is consistent with the leading idea underlying the overt pronoun constraint ( opc ) proposed by montalbetti ( 84 ) . experiment 1 compares the processing of overt pronouns and empty categories in object position in bp in structures in which these anaphors are a - bound by a subject and in structures in which they are a - bar-bound by a topic . results from 48 bp speakers indicate reactivation of the antecedents only by topic-bound gaps and by subject-bound overt pronouns in experiment 2 , the difference between the coreferential vs . bound readings in bp is further investigated by comparing the possibility of the strict and sloppy readings for the overt pronoun and the gap in object position . based on these experimental results , we argue for the classification of the bp null object as an instance of a null epithet , an empty r - expression with pronominal properties . the experiments are also informative with relation to several theoretical psycholinguistic issues . for more information , please contact gsil publications gsil @ scf . usc . edu south asian langs pan-asiatic linguistics : proceedings of the third international symposium on language and linguistics . chulalongkorn university , bangkok , thailand . 8-10 january 1992 . 1482 pp .

Subject: language as metaphor & metaphors for language - - session at aaa 98  i have volunteered to organize the following session for the next meeting of the society for linguistic anthropology at aaa 98 ( next winter in washington ) : language as metaphor and metaphors for language metaphor has been shown to be an integral component of the way we conceptualize experience and embody it in language . but metaphor can also be thought of as a specific tool that can be used in a variety of disciplines : a concrete image can summarize or illuminate the object of study , and sometimes even inform the direction of the discipline . new theories give rise to new metaphors , and the study of such metaphors can throw light on the development of theories . papers are invited from both linguists and non-linguists on two topics : 1 ) language used as metaphor : for a restricted communicative code used concurrently with language : e . g . the language of flowers ; but also for various characteristics of expressive or cognitive domains , e . g . the grammar / syntax / vocabulary of architecture , music , etc . ; what characteristics of language are used metaphorically ? to what do they correspond in other domains ? what is the usefulness of language metaphors for the domains in question ? 2 ) language as object of metaphor : what can language be compared to ? explicit ( e . g . neo-grammarian ' family tree ' ; saussure 's game of chess ; the city ) and implicit ( ? ) metaphors for language ; what do such metaphors reveal about language and how speakers view it ? how do metaphors for language relate to directions in linguistics ? please contact me : marie - lucie tarpent , mount st vincent u , halifax , n . s . b3m 2j6 canada ; 902-457 - 6172 ; marie-lucie . tarpent @ msvu . ca . 	0

Subject: semantics / syntax - semantics interface  tovena , lucia m . ; the fine structure of polarity sensitivity ; 0-8153 - 3133 - 9 , cloth ; pages , $ 71 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this study investigates the phenomenon of polarity sensitivity , proposing a new perspective which focuses on the behavior and properties of sensitive items and the phrases they form . it rests on the observation that the complexity of the phenomenon requires a more articulated analysis than the standard one based on licensing conditions . the study adopts a broader notion of sensitivity , which extends beyond the traditional one restricted to polarity . it includes other factors which are defined in relation to the semantics of the sensitive items . as a result , the attention is centered on the web of interactions the item entertains with its context of occurrence , rather than on polarity licensing conditions . these items are not lexical black boxes , mutually undistinguishable with respect to polarity licensing . the study shows that the distribution and interpretation of these items follow from constraints related to the properties of their semantic domain . aspect and temporal order are crucial factors for sensitive temporal connectives and adverbials , while referential links and existential import matter for determiners . analogies and differences with other phenomena related to negation , e . g . negative concord , are discussed . the volume also contains an extensive critical overview of research on the topic in the past thirty years . this book will be of interest to scholars in the area of semantics , syntax and their interface . it also points to various important themes in pragmatics and cognitive science , e . g . the role of context and reference , and the notion of interpretation strategies . e - mail : info @ garland . com 	0

"Subject: glow ' 99  call for papers : glow 1999 the glow 99 colloquium will be organized by the research center for general linguistics ( zas ) in berlin from 29th to 31st march 1999 . the conference will then continue in potsdam on 1st april with parallel workshops organized by the potsdam university and lot ( netherlands graduate school of linguistics ) . themes of the conference main colloquium : universals workshops : phonetics in phonology sources for universals technical aspects of movement calls : the colloquium : universals the search for universals has always been at the center of interest in generative linguistics . fundamental claims about universal properties of language are what we build into the very architecture of the theory of ug : primitives ( features etc . ) , combinatorial operations ( merge ) , the operation ' move ' , interfaces with extralinguistic systems ( lf , pf ) , etc . alongside such formal universals , we also seek substantive universals in inventories , markedness patterns , feature hierarchies etc . such facts may reflect properties of ug itself or derive from extralinguistic sources . recent growth in crosslinguistic study opens new opportunities for extending the empirical base , confirming or challenging old generalizations and establishing new ones . at the same time , recent theoretical developments in both phonology and syntax lead to important questions concerning the formal and / or substantive nature of universals in language , and the quest for the exact sources of variation between languages . in phonology , universals have typically been assumed to exist in many different subcomponents , e . g . features , prosodic constituents . only in recent years , with the emergence of output-based evaluation systems , has the focus of interest in universals shifted to the study of constraints and their interaction . hence new questions arise : are all constraints universal in the sense that they are constitutive of grammar ? should we conceive of constraints as being exhaustive and ordered ? are there universals that constraint orderings have to obey ? are there different domains ( i . e . lexical and postlexical level ) where constraints apply ? are there language-specific constraints ? syntactic theory in the early 80 's assumed principles common to all languages to interact with various types of ' macro-parameters ' : one deep property from which several other properties derive ( e . g . pro-drop parameter ) . later , variation was attributed to ' micro-parameters ' . now , with the emergence of minimalism and optimality , basic issues like what constitutes a universal principle / constraint , and what constitutes a parameter , need to be re-addressed . is there a universal inventory of functional heads / features ? as to the autonomy of , or the division of labour between syntax and morphology : is parametrized variation confined to inflectional systems ? is syntactic variation restricted to the choice of overt or zero realization of a given feature ? if all movement takes place in a single cycle , does variation reduce to the presence of affixes or the lack thereof ? are there universal constraints in morpho-syntax ? moreover , in recent years it has been argued that thematic relations are features . what are their characteristics ? do these have a universal inventory ? could they be parametrized ? many typological-descriptive generalizations await theoretical integration - e . g . greenbergian ' universals ' of word order patterns , cross-categorial harmony effects , etc . in this respect , kayne 's proposal for a universal ordering merely shifts the burden from phrase structure to movement . a guiding heuristic of generative grammar has been that parsimonious ( redundancy-free ) theories are to be preferred ; but minimalism goes further in suggesting that economy is built into ug itself . to what extent can the hypothesis that ug principles instantiate notions of economy be upheld ? in studying ug , we take the external systems with which it interfaces to be invariant in linguistically significant senses across individuals and languages . thus we posit universal interpretation mechanisms ( and uniformity across languages at lf ) , ' universal phonetics ' ( invariant articulatory / perceptual mechanisms ) , a universal parser , etc . ; so that variation is confined to grammars , in particular phonology / morphology and&nbsp ; aspects of the lexicon . yet properties of external systems may have far-reaching consequences for our view of ug . as we learn more about them , universals attributed to ug may have to be reassigned . what if ug - compatible grammars determine languages that cannot exist because they are unuseable ( unparseable ; unlearnable ; etc ) ? are there universal patterns in the acquisition process , in parsing strategies , etc . , that can be brought to bear ? the colloquium will consist of 20 talks of 45 minutes each plus discussion . abstracts may not exceed 2 pages with at least a 1 inch margin on all four sides and should employ a font not smaller than 12 pt . they should be sent anonymously in tenfold , accompanied by a camera-ready original with the author 's name , address and affiliation to : glow selection committee c / o artemis alexiadou zentrum fr allgemeine sprachwissenschaft , typologie und universalienforschung jgerstr . 10 / 11 , 10117 berlin germany phone : + 49-30 - 20192404 / 1 fax : + 49-30 - 20192402 e-mail : glow99 @ zas . gwz-berlin . de url : http : / / www . zas . gwz-berlin . de / events / glow / index . htm the workshops 1 . sources for universals recent developments in syntax and phonology such as the minimalist program or optimality theory have led to new insights into the structure of the human linguistic capacity . in the context of such theoretical developments , the conviction has grown that recourse to innate properties of language cannot be the only explanation for the existence of certain generalizations of formal linguistic structure . the idea of the workshop "" sources for universals "" is to bring together researchers from various fields inside and outside of syntax and phonology in order to identify possible sources for formal universals of natural language . such possible sources could come from the following domains , semantic universals consideration of processing difficulty considerations of laws of historical development for languages considersations of constraints on language acquisition biological constraints in the sense of a "" universal grammar "" constraints inherent in the computational mechanisms serving language , this list is not meant to be exhaustive . contributions which link formal universals as discussed in recent grammatical models to any of such sources are particularly welcomed . 2 . technical aspects of movement filler - gap dependencies ( fgd ) belong to the most intriguing properties of natural language grammatical theories have to deal with . finding the right approach continues to be a matter of no little controversy . capturing the core properties of fgds , concepts of strictest c-command , which require fillers and their gaps to be immediately attached to the same projection line , arguably possess a high amount of naturalness or simplicity . this type of constraint is directly reflected by linear indexed grammars and has been implemented in the minimalist extension condition on structure building . ( attempts to derive the c-command relation from the minimalist operation merge take this strategy even further . ) yet , head-movement configurations , analyzed as adjunction in the principles and parameters variant of generative grammar , seem to require weaker versions of c-command , such that the adjoined head ' inherits ' the c-command domain of the head adjoined to . it is an open question , whether there are alternatives that do not - one way or the other - employ similar auxiliary devices . as is well known , fgd - patterns ( nested / crossed ) have consequences for the generative power of the grammars describing them . it is not properly understood , however , which devices of which systems capture less orderly patterns best . systems using slash-categories or similar techniques seem to run into considerable difficulty here . feature - lists integrated into a checking theory of movement may be considered one of various alternatives . most recently , the minimalist adoption of the "" copy theory of movement "" opened up another array of related issues . how , for example , do checking resources get eliminated if each step leading to elimination is preceded by a step of copying these resources ? are copies of np / wh - moved constituents assumed to retain properties of empty anaphors and syntactic variables respectively , or has any reference to empty categories ( e . g . ecp ) and their potential link to binding theory become undefined ? if the latter , could this change be motivated by complexity results concerning the powerful device of free indexation , as employed by gb binding theory ? indeed , a general ban on the use of indices has been accompanying the "" copy theory of movement "" . this calls for a demonstration how chains , the standard "" legitimate lf - objects "" , which in alternative versions of syntax are supposed to fully supplant movement , get handled without such devices . primary properties to be defined on chains of copies , for example , would be pf - realizability as well as the distinction between operator , variable , and descriptive content status at lf ( nontrivial consequences for the analyses of qr and acd being directly implied ) . alternatively , it would be helpful to be able to appreciate how far any worked-out proposals deviate from structure-sharing techniques as used in hpsg / lfg ( a . o . ) , index percolation devices from variants of indexed grammar , and other structure generating systems like tree adjoining grammar or categorial grammar . this workshop invites submissions of papers shedding light on the above questions from both technical / formal and linguistic angles . abstracts for both workshops are invited for 45 minute presentations ( plus 15 minutes dicussion ) . they should not exceed one page / 500 words . please send five anonymous copies plus a camera ready original ( with author 's name , address , and affiliation ) to the address specified below . speakers will be partially reimbursed for their expenses on the scale that applies to the colloquium . glow workshops c / o matthias schlesewsky institut fuer linguistik universitt potsdam postfach 60 15 53 d 14415 potsdam germany phone : x49 - 331-977 - 2016 fax : x49 - 331-977 - 2761 e-mail : glow _ workshop @ ling . uni-potsdam . de url : http : / / www . ling . uni-potsdam . de / ik / glow . html 3 . phonetics in phonology invited speakers : edward flemming , donca steriade organizers : carlos gussenhoven , ren kager the workshop is broadly concerned with the relevance of articulatory and perceptual facts for phonological theory . more specifically , it intends to focus on such questions as the extent to which functional factors determine phonological grammars , the status of the distinction between phonological representation and phonetic implementation , the issue of multiple ( articulation-based as well as perception-based ) phonological representations , and the universality and ` groundedness ' of phonological constraints . the workshop will consist of approximately 7 talks of 45 minutes each , followed by 15 minutes of discussion . abstracts may not exceed one page with at least a 1 inch margin on all four sides and should employ a font no smaller than 12 pt . they should be sent anonymously in threefold , accompanied by a camera-ready original with the author 's name , address and affiliation , to glow phonology workshop c / o . ren kager utrecht institute of linguistics / ots trans 10 3512 jk utrecht netherlands phone : + 31-30 - 2538064 fax : + 31-30 - 2536000 deadline for submission of abstracts : december 1 , 1998 submission by fax or e-mail will not be accepted .

"Subject: _ rightward movement _ review - - ii  [ editor 's note : the following is the second part of a review of beerman et al . _ righward movement _ . the first part is to be found in the previous issue of linguist . ] most of frank drijkoningen 's paper ` morphological strength : np positions in french ' ( pp . 81-114 ) is devoted to a clever account of the relative ordering of subjects and verbs , and parts thereof , in french , with especially focus on inversion constructions , demonstrating that the data can be described in a manner consistent with kayne 's antisymmetry theory - - provided one adopts a certain amount of occam - stretching multiplication of functional heads with resultant multiple spec - positions as ` homes ' for subjects . drijkoningen argues fairly convincingly for the following hierarchical ordering of functional heads in french : [ c [ t [ agr ( s ) [ agr ( o ) [ agr ( a ) [ vp ] ] ] ] ] ] , identifying participial agreement not with agr ( o ) but with agr ( a ) , the checking-site for predicate - adjective agreement . he also offers a hypothesis with regard to a trigger for french stylistic inversion ( in which the subject np follows the verbal complex ) . his assumption is that ( in both french and english ) spec - head agr features in infl are ` strong ' , while head - features in infl are ` strong ' in french but ` weak ' in english . however , overt saturation of spec - head agr features in cp ( e . g . , by fronting an overt wh-expression ) significantly reduces the strength of spec - head agr features in ip , obviating the need for the subject np to rise to spec - agr ( s ) for checking . the paper is characterized by heavy reliance on ` floating / stranded _ tous _ ' , i . e . , a quantifier separated superficially from the np it modifies . this reviewer found little or no evidence of any awareness of the possibility of q - movement independent of movement of the modified np ; many of the starred strings could actually be derived , assuming a kayne approach , if q were allowed to move on its own . there was no sign of any argument that such movement is impossible ; perhaps it can be ruled out by lack of motivation . this paper is a thick , but rather strong argument for underlying svo and exclusively leftward - movement in french . of course , few linguists would contest that french is svo , and what evidence there may be for rightward - movement in this language has always been a best peripheral ( pun intended ) . given the strong arguments for rm and head-finality in other languages presented by bayer and buring & hartmann , this paper seems like a lot of sound and fury . erik hoekstra 's paper , ` analysing linear asymmetries in the verb clusters of dutch and frisian and their dialects ' ( pp . 153-170 ) , presents an analysis in terms of kayne 's lca hypothesis of the syntax of the complex verb clusters so especially characteristic of these languages . in the course of his discussion , it gradually becomes clear that , on the basis of the ordering of elements within these clusters , he distinguishes between dutch and frisian as respectively ` head-initial ' and ` head-final ' . it is clear to this reviewer why these labels are appropriate specifically with regard to the internal syntax of verb clusters , but describing dutch as ` head-initial ' is likely to be a surprise to many people who thought they knew otherwise . in discussing the feasibility , or lack thereof , of inserting non - verbal material ( including particles ) between members of a verb cluster , hoekstra not only demonstrates that this follows very reasonably from the lca - account he is proposing but claims ( p . 158 ) that ` the rigidity of head-final clusters [ i . e . , their intolerance of such insertion ] . . . is a mystery for any approach not incorporating asymmetry . ' in fact , it makes perfect sense if we assume an underlying head-final order and the derivation of alternative orders by the rm of verbal projections . this reviewer is not necessarily suggesting that this is a * better * approach than hoekstra 's lca - account , but it is certainly quite feasible , contrary to his apparent belief . in the last section , hoekstra spends a fair amount of time on a very interesting discussion of the infinitivum - pro - participio ( ipp ) effect , whereby in some germanic languages ( e . g . , dutch ) a ( perfective ) participle taking an infinitive verb as its complement must itself surface in the form of an infinitive . the primary questions at issue for hoekstra are : what is the formal grammatical nature of the ipp effect ? and why is it characteristic only of some ( germanic ) languages and not of others ? hoekstra argues that the ipp effect only occurs in languages in which the perfective participle is marked by a prefix , e . g . the germanic prefix ` ge - ' or reflexes thereof , and that this prefix occupies the spec position of the verb to which it is morphologically attached . since under these circumstances that spec position is already occupied , it is impossible for the infinitive complement to move into that position as it must , the derivation crashes ; the loophole exploited by dutch and other ipp languages ( this is , in fact , the traditional analysis in germanic scholarship ) is the substitution of an ` alternative ' form of the participle which is morphophonologically identical to the infinitive ( and therefore , in hoekstra 's view , has no obstructionist prefix ) . the fact that frisian does not exhibit ipp effects , according to this analysis , is directly related to the fact that in frisian the perfective participle is marked only by a suffix . this reviewer admits to not being familiar with the scholarly literature on the subject of ipp , but notes some curiosity as to how hoekstra 's claim ( p . 159 ) that ` the ipp effect is systematically absent in head - final germanic dialects ' can be squared with the fact that german , which is clearly head-final in the sense that hoekstra uses the term , typically marks perfective participles with a prefix and , indeed , exhibits ipp . the last few pages of the paper are devoted to a very nice little discussion of the recent evolution of ipp in a couple of frisian dialects , which hoekstra argues is due in both cases to remarkably heavy contact with dutch . in this reviewer 's opinion , this section represents a very desirable conjunction of scholarship and concerns in sociolinguistics and linguistic evolution on the one hand and formal grammatical theory on the other . in his paper ` movement in japanese relative clauses ' ( pp . 171-185 ) , satoshi stanley koike argues that all relative clauses in japanese , including the ` externally-headed ' ones whose ` heads ' are ( apparently ) ` extracted ' to their right , can be accounted for in terms of a kayne lca - type analysis allowing only spec - head - comp base structures and leftward movement . noting certain problems resulting from adopting kayne 's analysis , koike makes clear that they are almost certainly obviated by his ( * very interesting * ) proposal of a * discourse-based * motivation for the leftward movement his adoption of kayne 's lca approach forces him to assume . koike 's hypothesis that the movement of ip in these japanese cases is essentially stylistic movement , i . e . , motivated by pragmatic or discourse considerations rather than purely syntactic ones , at least implies that it is pf - movement which would ( 1 ) account for the fact that , in order for his analysis to make the right predictions , * have * to follow the movement of the semantic ` head ' np - - the latter being a proper ` syntactic ' movement - ( 2 ) be invisible as far as binding theory is concerned , binding theory being relevant primarily at lf and totally irrelevant at pf , and ( 3 ) not be subject to relativized minimality either . in their paper ` rightward wh - movement in american sign language ' ( pp . 247-278 ) , carol neidle , judy kegl , benjamin bahan , debra aarons , & dawn maclaughlin argue that americal sign language ( asl ) exhibits a head-final cp with a right-marginal spec as landing-site for wh - movement . they note ( p . 267 ) that this proposal ` is partially consistent with kayne 's claims about universal ordering ' , in that it places spec and complement on opposite sides of the head ; however , their proposal differs from kayne 's universal antisymmetry approach in positing a head-final structure for cp while assuming head-initial structures for all its complement-daughters . neidle et al . base much of their anti - lca argument on the fact that certain syntactic features ( including polarity , + / - wh , etc . ) are in asl expressed by ` non-manual markers ' ( e . g . , facial expressions ) which frequently spread over certain portions of the clauses they are associated with , and the very plausible notion that those portions can be defined as the c-command domains of the functional heads associated with these features . thus , the possibility , or lack thereof , of such spreading in asl is taken as symptomatic of the presence or absence of c-command relations ( p . 250 ) . it is on the basis of such spreading that they argue that the landing-site for wh - movement in asl , which is clearly to the right of the clause , nevertheless c-commands the latter , and they demonstrate that these c-command facts are incompatible with a kayne - type analysis . they briefly entertain analyses more consistent with kayne 's lca - hypothesis , involving the raising of c and ip into higher positions ( which , they note , must nevertheless be below positions , e . g . the landing-site of topicalization , known to be above cp in asl ) , but point out that there is ( 1 ) no evidence as to the functional nature of such positions , ( 2 ) no independent motivation for their existence , and ( 3 ) no evident motivation for the movement they are discussing . in their paper ` language types and generative grammar : a review of some consequences of the univeral vo hypothesis ' ( pp . 331-357 ) , caterina donati & alessandra tomaselli address the repercussions of kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis for constituent-order typological studies . they demonstrate very neatly and elegantly the manifold empirical problems kayne 's approach has with languages representing a variety of types , including ( 1 ) ov languages with v2 ( german , dutch ) , ( 2 ) svo languages without pro-drop ( english , french ) , ( 3 ) svo languages with pro-drop ( italian ) , and ( 4 ) vso languages ( irish ) . repeatedly , they demonstrate that more traditional analyses provide more accurate results than analyses assuming kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis . it should be noted that donati & tomaselli are throughout addressing specifically the relative ordering of verbs and nominals in ordinary , garden-variety clauses ; the details of extraposed structures such as those discussed by bayer , buring & hartmann , and haider are not addressed in this paper . while as already noted half the papers in this collection , understandably , discuss ` extraposition ' , it is unfortunate that there are no papers focussing ( pun intended ) on adverbal focus-movement , a serious alternative candidate for a rm analysis ( for which cf . schaufele 1990 , 1998 ) . neidle et al . 's paper relates to focus in an indirect way , in that it is commonly assumed that wh-elements are a priori focussed and that therefore their s - structure location , especially if there is anything remarkable about it , should be considered as at least a possible landing-site for focus-movement . as a sort of appendix , koike offers a short discussion of rightward focus-movement in turkish , in which he suggests that the same kind of discourse-analysis motivation he proposes for the movement leftward of ` backgrounded ' relative clauses ( away from their semantic ` heads ' ) in japanese can also motivate the movement leftward of * non-focussed * arguments in turkish , leaving the focussed subject stranded in immediately pre-verbal position ( at least in terms of superficial order ) . this reviewer notes , however , that koike makes reference to a single turkish example , a very simple clause involving only three constituents , an object np , a subject np , and a verb , and doubts very much that such an account as he proposes would be able to make much sense out of the much more complex examples of subject-focussing discussed in schaufele 1990 , 1998 . i have complaints about muller 's and hoekstra 's papers at an expository level , in that both assumed on the part of the reader a high degree of familiarity with the languages being discussed . muller provides no english translations for any of his german example sentences , or for that matter of the one hindi example sentence . while this reviewer has little trouble reading and interpreting example sentences in these languages , such facility cannot be expected of most readers of this collection . likewise , hoekstra offered no translations of any of his example sentences , and in many cases this reviewer , who is not unfamiliar with a wide variety of germanic languages , was quite unable to make any sense out of them . furthermore , it is frequently not made clear which language the example in question is meant to represent ; since the paper as a whole depends crucially on distinctions between dutch and frisian , this is a source of serious obscurity . and only on p . 158 , the 6th page of a fairly short paper , does hoekstra finally tell us that the gloss ` mp ' stands for ` modal particle ' , after having used this abbreviation freely in several earlier examples . this abbreviation may be familiar to specialists in netherlandic , but it is n't to a lot of other interested readers . in koike 's paper the inclusion of japanese words in the midst of the english - language text without any typographical highlighting by either quotes or italics , especially in a book with many typographical errors , proved a little unsettling ; this was also a problem in muller 's paper , where it was particularly confusing in the one section that discussed extraposition in english . the book as a whole is plagued with typographical errors . there are two examples ( 59 ) in drijkoningen 's paper . haider 's ( 58a ) is starred , but is in fact an ok string , and it 's obvious from context that haider regards it as ok . in buring & hartmann 's paper , there are exs . ( 21a ) and ( 22a ) , but no ( 21b ) or ( 22b ) ; diagram ( 24 ) is nowhere referred to in the text ( though it 's pretty obvious what it refers to ) . [ bayer in press ] is referred to several times in bayer 's paper , but it does n't appear anywhere in the references ; perhaps it 's represented by bayer 1996 ? the statement of wiltschko 's locality constraint is misprinted on p . 360 in such a way as to be nonsensical . in koike 's paper the alignment of the glosses in ( 20a ) was impossible to make any sense out of , and i had to study ( 10 ) a while before i realized that , although it said literally ` [ dp ip d [ cp np / qp [ c [ ip . . . ' , those biliterals ` dp ' , ` cp ' , and ` ip ' were in some instances meant to be labels on the immediately preceding brackets , not left-daughters of the constituents enclosed within said brackets . mahajan 's paper is particularly plagued with typographical errors ; to mention merely the most egregious example i found , in ( 54 ) the entire direct object np is missing from the hindi string , rendering this example 's relevance to the discussion is completely opaque . as already noted here and there , many of the substantive flaws in this collection are due primarily or entirely to lack of space in which to present relevant arguments . fulfilling the preface 's promise of open-mindedness , the book brings together papers from several different viewpoints , both supporting and undermining kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis . while many of the contributors obviously hold rather strongly to whatever side of this controversy they espouse , many of them are to be commended for the skill and seriousness they nevertheless give to the necessary task of considering possible alternative analyses that would support the other side . while many of the papers focus on languages , and constructions within those languages , that have already been much discussed in the generative literature , there are some admirable exceptions ; i would especially mention the papers by bayer , hoekstra , and neidle et al . in this regard , also the typological interest behind the paper by donati & tomaselli although they restrict themselves primarily to western european languages . anyone concerned about understanding the debates arising out of kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis and the grounds both for taking it seriously and for rejecting it cannot afford to ignore this collection . references . bayer , josef .

"Subject: re : check this out !  dear friend , greetings ! hopefully my name is on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is basically the same letter you havve in your hands . he asked me to verify that this letter was legal . i told him i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off the wall idea to make money . a week and a half later we met in my offic to discuss the issue . i told him the letter he brought me was not 100 % legal and advised him to make a small change so it would be . i was still curious about the letter and he told me how it works . i thought it was a longshot so i decided against participation , but before my client left i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later , he called me to tell me he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! i did n't believe him , so he suggested i try his idea to find out for myself . i thought about it for a couple of weeks and decided i had nothing to lose . i asked him for a copy of the letter and followed the instructions exactly , mailed out 200 copies and sure enough , the money started arriving ! it came slowly at first but after three weeks i was getting more mail than i could open in a day ! after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise copy of my earnings and at the end of the three months they totaled $ 968 , 493 ! i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i decided to try the letter again but this time sent out 500 letters . well , three months later , my earnings totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 ! i just could not believe it , i met with my old client for lunch to find out how it worked . what made this one different from others were that there are six names on the list , not five like most others . that fact alone results in your name being on far more returns . the other factor was the help i gave him in ensuring the whole thing was legal , since nobody wants to risk doing something illegal . i ' ll bet by now you are curious to know what little change i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to make it legal you must actually sell something if you expect to receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the six people on the list , you must include a slip of paper with the words , "" please put me on your mailing list "" and enclose your mailing address . you need not include your name . this is the legal key to this program ! the item you received for the dollar you send the six names below is this letter and the right to earn thousands ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in three months you should receive over $ 800 , 000 ! ! ! $ 800 , 000 in less than 90 days ! ! ! guaranteed ! ! here is the business capital you need ! act now and be finacially solvent by the year 1999 ! ! this is a method of raising capital that really works every time , 100 percent . i ' m sure you could use the money in the next 20 to 90 day . s please study this carfully . this is not a chain letter ! this is a perfectly legal money making opportunity that will cost you a couple of rolls of stamps , a mailing list and six bucks . follow these instructions exactly and you will receive $ 800 , 000 in cash from business minded individuals just like yourself . 1 . immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the names below , and a note requesting you be added to their mailing lists . it is this important step that makes the system legal 2 . omit the name in the number 1 position and move each of the other names up one place ( number 2 becomes number 1 , number 3 becomes number 2 , 4 becomes number 3 etc . ) put your own name and address in the sixth position ( an easy way to do this is to type the six names , with your own name as number six , on a separate sheet of paper and tape over the area where the names are printed . ) 3 . print out 200 copies of these pages with the new list of names that you have created . your name now in the sixth position , in place of the current list of names . 4 . purchase a mailing list from the dataline co . or any other mail list sellers . most names list sell 200 names for only $ 26 . 00 . the best part is that the list of names come on self-adhesive labels that easily peel and stick to the envelope . just call 1-800 - 497-2912 . * * * mailing lists are also available from list associates at 1-888 - 359-2621 or mailing lists at 954-742 - 9519 . or check on the internet for other mail brokers . 5 . while waiting for the mailing list to arrive , place each of your 200 copies into business sized envelopes and seal them . go to the post office and purchase 200 . 32 cent stamps and place them on the envelopes . do not put your return address on the envelopes . . . this will peak the curiosity of the recipient . 6 . once your list arrives , place an address label on each of the 200 envelopes and drop them in the mailbox . within 20 to 90 days you will recieve over $ 800 , 000 in cash - and its all yours ! now comes the interesting part . . that 's with only a 7 . 5 % response rate ( which is very conservative . it 's more than possible to reach the amount every time ! ) the first time i participated my response rate was 9 . 5 % . my second was over 11 % 7 . keep this letter so you can use it as many times as you wish . using the addresses that people send you can raise the response rate because they also wish to conitine receiving more capital . * * this system was made for the purpose of accumulating capital fast and honestly . once again , this is not a chain letter , but perfectly legal ( refer to title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 of the united states postal and lottery laws ) . when you send out 200 copies of this letter , each responsive individual sends out 200 copies and send you $ 1 . 00 , thereby multiplying your fortune very rapidly ! examine the chart of how this system is the best in america for raising capital ! ! ! * * you mail 200 letters , multiply that by 7 . 5 % return rate = 15 people + $ 15 * * 15 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 225 people = $ 225 * * 225 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 3375 people = $ 3375 * * 3375 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 50 , 625 people = $ 50 , 625 * * 50 , 625 people mail 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 759 , 375 people = $ 759 , 375 * * * at this point your name drops off the list , but so far you ' ve received $ 813 , 615 ! ! ! * be sure to mail $ 1 . 00 to each of teh six names on the list * 1 . john salinas 100 deseret dr . , pasco , wa 99301 2 . elizabeth potts 7714 west jenan dr , peoria , az 85345 3 . lavonda walton 4005 parkway apt . # 11 , temple hills , md 20748 4 . murry mcneal 316 rachels trail , st . peters , mo 63376 5 . joseph swenson 544 1 / 2 7th ave w . , kalispell , mt 59901 6 . suzy krogman po box 802167 , santa clarita , ca 91380 this system is guaranteed to work 100 percent of the time in raising capital , but , if you remove any other name aside from the one in the number one position , you will not be covered by the title 18 in the u . s . postal law . the best part about this is you won't be hurting anyone . it will take only about $ 100 to participate . it is legal , so make money honestly and start today !

Subject: axiomatic linguistics  james dickins extended axiomatic linguistics 1998 . 23 x 15 , 5 cm . xii , 493 pages cloth dm 198 , - / approx . us $ 124 . 00 isbn 3-11 - 016086 - 2 trends in linguistics . studies and monographs 111 mouton de gruyter * berlin * new york this volume presents the semiotic and linguistic theory of extended axiomatic functionalism , focusing on its application to linguistic description . the theory is compared with other approaches to semiotics and linguistics , and particularly with the standard version of axiomatic functionalism . an informal account is given of the twin basic components of the theory - the signum ontology and the system ontology . the former provides a set-theoretically based account of the network of relationships between the abstractions of linguistic theory ( at whose apex stands the signum ) , and the phonetic and semantic facts of speech events . the latter deals with the purely abstract level of analysis , and covers roughly the traditional areas of phonology and grammar . a set of postulates , constituting a formal statement of the theory , is provided in an appendix . it is shown that the signum ontology can provide adequate accounts - sometimes in conjunction with interfacing extra-theoretical models - of a range of phenomena from phonetics to pragmatics , including incomplete neutralization , imperfect synonymy , polysemy , idiom , and figures of speech ( particularly metaphor ) . the relationship between core-linguistics and psycholinguistics is considered , and an initial model is developed for the interface between extended axiomatic functionalism , as a sentence-linguistic theory , and text-linguistics . the issues dealt with in this book are not only relevant to extended axiomatic functionalism and indicative of its broad scope , but are also of current interest in linguistics generally ; the analyses proposed are considered in the context of existing analyses throughout . without disguising complexities , the book presents extended axiomatic functionalism in a clear and accessible manner . wide use is made of figures and cross-referencing , and detailed indices are provided . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ mouton de gruyter walter de gruyter , inc . postfach 30 34 21 200 saw mill river road d-10728 berlin hawthorne , ny 10532 germany usa fax : + 49 ( 0 ) 30 26005-351 fax : + 1 914 747-1326 email : mouton @ degruyter . de this and further publications can also be ordered via world wide web : http : / / www . degruyter . com 	0
"Subject: linguistic theory and computational linguistics  bod , rens ( university of amsterdam ) ; beyond grammar : an experience-based theory of language ; isbn : 1-57586 - 150 - x ( paper ) , 1-57586 - 151 - 8 ( cloth ) ; 184 pp . csli publications 1998 : http : / / csli-www . stanford . edu / publications / email : pubs @ roslin . stanford . edu . during the last few years , a new approach to linguistic analysis has started to emerge . this approach , which has come to be known under various labels such as "" data-oriented parsing "" , "" corpus-based interpretation "" and "" treebank grammar "" , embodies the assumption that human language comprehension and production works with representations of concrete past language experiences rather than with abstract grammatical rules . the models that instantiate this approach operate by decomposing the given representations into fragments and recomposing those pieces to analyze ( infinitely many ) new utterances . a probability model is used to choose from the collection of different fragments those that make up the most appropriate representation of an utterance . this book shows how this general approach can apply to various kinds of linguistic representations , ranging from phrase-structure trees , compositional semantic representations , dialogue representations , and lexical-functional grammar representations . the resulting models are utilized for the automatic acquisition of language , for harnessing ambiguity and for processing of spoken dialogue . experiments with these models suggest that the productive units of natural language cannot be defined by a minimal set of rules or principles , but need to be defined by a large , redundant set of previously experienced structures . bod argues that this outcome has important consequences for linguistic theory , leading to an entirely new view of the nature of linguistic competence and the relationship between linguistic theory and models of performance . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * csli publications ventura hall stanford university stanford , ca 94305-4115 telephone ( 650 ) 723-1839 fax ( 650 ) 725-2166 http : / / csli-publications . stanford . edu / "	0

Subject: tei report , call for proposals  the future of the tei report and final invitation for proposals 1 background information as reported on this list in early september , the text encoding initiative is considering options for its future organization and funding , and is actively exploring the possibility of a consortium or cooperative organization to support the maintenance and extension of the tei guidelines . on 3 - 4 october , the tei executive committee met with representatives of the tei 's sponsoring organizations ( ach , acl , and allc ) and of some prospective host institutions . the purpose of this note is - to report to the community on the steps being taken toward the goal of a new organization for the tei , - to outline for all concerned the current schedule of events leading toward a final decision , and - to reiterate the invitation for institutions interested in hosting a tei organization to contact the tei as soon as possible , in order to ensure that any proposals can receive full consideration . 2 issues list in the course of the meeting , we elaborated a list of issues which must be resolved in the course of any decision on the tei 's future organization and structure ; any proposal for organizing and hosting a tei structure is expected to address these questions . - intellectual property rights : the tei 's sponsoring organizations are taking steps to clarify the current status of rights in the tei ; any new structure needs to make clear how those rights are to be managed in the future . there is a strong conviction that in any new organizational structure the results of the tei 's work must remain publicly accessible , as they are now . - the governance and legal status of the proposed organization must be described . it is essential that the legal structure be one that allows full participation by institutions and individuals from all countries ; in particular , institutions in the european and north american countries where tei activity and use are currently most common should be on an equal footing . - proposals need to specify a plausible business plan and indicate the level of fees and other funding needed to make the proposed organization self-sustaining . the executive committee and sponsoring organizations have no particular requirements on this topic ( beyond the hope that membership fees not be prohibitively expensive ) ; prospective hosts must take into account the cultural differences between europe and america as regards fees for membership in consortia and cooperative organizations . - geography : there is a strong wish that the international flavor of the tei be maintained with regard to the membership , governance , and provision of service by a tei organization . - the tei has developed a structure and a set of procedures for organizing and carrying out the intellectual work of maintaining the guidelines ; proposals for the tei 's future need to specify in how far these procedures will be retained , and how they will be changed . - proposals for a tei organization should contain provisions describing what is to happen if the organization is unsuccessful ; such a fall-back plan should provide among other things for the reversion of the tei to the original sponsoring organizations . - the future role of the current sponsoring organizations in the future guidance of the tei must be spelled out . there is , in principle , a broad range of possibilities here ; in practice , the current sponsoring organizations wish to have some active role in the governance of the tei , at least for some initial period - - both in order to ensure continuity in the project and to demonstrate their continuing support for the tei and its goals . - the scope of the proposed organization or cooperative must also be clear - - where 's cope ' may be described in terms of discipline , or of type of activity , or of the common bases or foci of activities . the sponsoring organizations recognize that standards of many kinds may be relevant to the activities of their members , and they expect to continue collaborating with each other on standards of mutual concern . whatever institutional and organizational framework is set up for the tei must be in a position to collaborate flexibly with future initiatives of the sponsoring organizations ( as well as continuing the tei 's involvement in work on related standards like xml ) . 3 timetable the timetable for the decision about the future organization of the tei is as follows : 31 october 1998 : initial proposals should be received from prospective hosts . november 1998 : a review committee consisting of the tei executive committee and additional representatives from the sponsoring organizations will review and discuss the proposals and ask proposers for explanations and clarification of matters of detail in the proposals . 30 november 1998 : cut-off for the discussion process , and deadline for submission of revised proposals , with full institutional commitments . early to mid - december 1998 : a short list of proposals will be selected , and proposers will be notified and invited to give final presentations at a meeting in january 1999 . mid - january 1999 : meeting of review committee to receive final presentations , following which the sponsoring organizations will decide the future arrangements for the tei . 31 january 1999 : public announcement of the decision made by the sponsoring organizations will be made by the end of january . 4 invitation institutions interested in proposing to organize and host a tei organization ( or to make any other proposal for the future of the tei ) should contact the tei secretariat as soon as possible at the address below for further information , since initial proposals are expected at the end of october , and final proposals , including full institutional commitments , are due 30 november . members of the sponsoring organizations , or other users of the tei , who would like to express their views on any of the issues outlined above , or to suggest other issues that should be considered , are invited to comment on tei - l , or to contact the appropriate bodies within their association , or to write directly to the tei executive committee in care of the address below . - c . m . sperberg - mcqueen , university of illinois at chicago lou burnard , oxford university tei secretariat : c . m . sperberg - mcqueen , tei @ uic . edu 	0

"Subject: re : 6 . 249 dick armey 's slip and correction  could someone provide the context for dick armey 's utterance of "" barney fag "" ? i only heard it once and did n't write it down . my impression at the time , however , was that the phonological environment did n't seem quite right for a spoonerism . one other thought : it seems that a binary opposition between an intentional slur on armey 's part and a purely phonological slip does n't represent all the possibilities . it 's certainly possible that if the string "" barney fag "" has been used often enough on capitol hill in the hearing of dick armey , he might very well have inadvertently substituted it for frank 's actual name . is n't that something that 's done all the time : accidentally saying something that one has heard recently or repeatedly . "" can't get that tune out of my head ! "" seems like a reasonable explanation for a "" slip "" that was n't a spoonerism . anything on non-spoonerism phonological slips out there that bears on this ? phil gaines "	0

"Subject: sum : x - rays and acoustic signals  dear linguist members , some weeks ago i published a request for information about methods of measuring movements of the articulating organs . within this field i was especially interested in x - ray documentation and films . alice faber ( faber @ haskins . yale . edu ) wrote that "" back in the 1960 's the center for applied linguistics here in the us made a set of such films of ' exotic ' languages . we have a set here at haskins , . . . "" caroline smith reported on another method of measurement . she wrote that a method of measurement which works on the basis of electromagnetism was used by "" the people at the institut fuer phonetik und sprachliche kommunikation der universitaet muenchen , who are the world leaders in electromagneticarticulography ( fipkm @ phonetik . uni-muenchen . de ) . "" bob port ( port @ cs . indiana . edu ) from indiana reports on "" x - ray microbeam data at univ of wisconsin . "" and continues "" there is now a large amount of material available , but is not in video form "" a most interesting hint at x - ray documentation i want to give verbally at this place : kenneth r . beesley ( ken . beesley @ xerox . fr ) writes : "" i have also seen x - ray movies from the eastman collection in rochester , new york . these films show , among many other things , people talking , playing musical instruments , and moving in various ways . for medical interest , there are also films of swallowing and bladder functions . i have seen some x - ray photographs of vowel-production settings from the old ussr , but these are less interesting than films . the eastman films , produced in the 1940s and early 50s , i believe , are unintentionally frightening because the doses of x - rays considered safe then were perhaps 500 times what they are now . as best i can remember , these films were somewhat inspired by x - ray films made by the nazis using inmates of concentration camps . these films , brought back to the united states after the war , were watched in fascination by eastman and his colleagues . they featured scenes with full skeletons walking about . the x - ray doses were no doubt fatal to the victims . "" beesley also reports on phoneticians from the university of glasgow , scotland and members of the school of dentistry , who some eighteen years ago produced x - ray images that show people talking . helmer strike ( strik @ let . kun . nl ) delivers two methods of measuring articulation : "" the technique that resembles the old x - ray films the most is called mri ( magnetic resonance imaging ) . a good article on this topic is baer et al . ( 1991 ) journal of the acoustical society of america , nr . 90 ( 2 ) , pp . 799 - 828 . . . . another , quite different technique , which is used very often , is called epg ( electro - palato - graphy ) "" in particular , i would like to thank ocke bohn ( gen01 . @ rz . uni-kiel . d400 . de ) for having sent me an article on how to describe articulation by means of infrared light . she reported as well on experiments using ultrasound for recording the movements of the articulating organs . in conclusion , i want to give another idea of how to make use of cd-rom in combination with x - ray technology . today 's technology has made it possible to save pictures and videos ( here videos produced through x - rays ) conveniently down onto a cd . this opens up the possibility to combine recordings of various institutions on one cd and , by means of this collection , deliver an outstanding contribution to the further understanding of what is happening when people talk . besides the actual recordings , further information about videos and x - ray images that concerns both the history of this subject and its methodology could be gathered in one single multi media application in such a way that a cd like this would provide important information about the topic "" articulation and the methods of its measurement "" in a user-friendly way and , what is more , would be available for a greater number of non-expert pc - users . anyone interested in this project and willing to support this idea should write to one of the following addresses : e - mail : fran2801 @ pcmail . uni-trier . de home : ingolf franke zeughausstrasse 31 d-54292 trier germany "	0

Subject: language maintenance and loss  third international conference on maintenance and loss of minority languages koningshof conference center , veldhoven , the netherlands november 26 - november 27 , 1998 call for papers and registration introduction in line with the two previous international conferences on maintenance and loss of minority languages ( noordwijkerhout , the netherlands ; 1988 and 1992 ) , the aim of this conference is to bring together recent developments from various disciplines . the ambition of this third conference is to offer a major contribution to a theoretical discussion on the determinants of language shift and language loss , supported by the exchange of new research data . while the two preceding conferences concentrated mainly on the questions ` what is lost of the language ? ' ( structural-linguistic aspects ) and ` why does shift occur ? ' ( sociological and social-psychological explanatory factors ) , the veldhoven conference will focus on two questions ; ` why does shift occur ? ' and ` how is a language lost ? ' , i . e . , what are the psycholinguistic processes involved in language loss ? emphasis will be on the interaction between the process of transferring from the first to the second language and the gradual decline of skills in the first language , at the individual and group levels . the conference takes place on two consecutive days . plenary speakers are invited to make inspiring and thought-provoking remarks on the two conference themes outlined above , as well as on the broader theoretical framework . together with the contributions of the free paper presenters , the interaction between plenary speakers and participants forms the input for workshops and a round table discussion on the development of an integrated theoretical framework . this framework can then serve as a renewed starting point for continued research into language shift and loss in the new millennium . the organizing committee is also open to contributions from disciplines that have recently entered or touched upon the field and may shed a new light on the language change processes involved . the organizing committee will determine the best manner in which the results of the conference can be published . programme the conference will consist of three sections . the first section addresses the sociological and social-psychological explanatory context in which language shift processes take place . the second section deals with language attrition from a psycholinguistic perspective , and the third is fully devoted to the building of an integrated explanatory framework for processes of language shift and loss . in memory of willem fase , one of the initiators of the first and second conference on maintenance and loss of minority languages , who died in 1997 , a new forum called the willem fase lecture has been set up . this plenary lecture forum will be granted to a promising scholar , to be selected from the abstracts submitted . thursday , november 26 , 1998 section i : language shift from a sociological and social-psychological perspective 08 . 30-09 . 30 registration at koningshof conference center , veldhoven , the netherlands tea / coffee 09 . 30-10 . 00 conference opening 10 . 00-11 . 00 plenary session : lesley milroy 11 . 00-12 . 00 plenary session : richard bourhis 12 . 00-13 . 00 lunch 13 . 00-13 . 45 parallel sessions of free papers 13 . 45-14 . 30 parallel sessions 14 . 30-15 . 15 parallel sessions 15 . 15-15 . 30 closing session of section i 15 . 30-16 . 00 tea / coffee section ii : language loss from a psycholinguistic perspective 16 . 00-17 . 00 plenary session : kees de bot 17 . 00-17 . 45 parallel sessions 17 . 45-18 . 30 parallel sessions 19 . 00-20 . 30 dinner friday , november 27 , 1998 section ii continued : language loss from a psycholinguistic perspective 08 . 30-09 . 30 plenary session : joel walters 09 . 30-10 . 15 parallel sessions 10 . 15-10 . 30 closing session of section ii 10 . 30-11 . 00 tea / coffee 11 . 00-12 . 00 plenary session : willem fase lecture 12 . 00-13 . 00 lunch section iii : towards an integrated explanatory framework for processes of language shift and loss 13 . 00-15 . 00 preparatory workshops 15 . 00-15 . 30 tea / coffee 15 . 30-17 . 00 round table chaired by michael clyne 17 . 00-17 . 30 closing session of conference general information conference secretariat tilburg university research group on language and minorities c / o heleen strating -

"Subject: 6 . 351 language policy  frank ashen focussed on the divisive effects of promoting one of several indigenous languages to the position of official language and used the much quoted justification that speakers of not-chosen languages may feel disadvantaged . he did not mention the effect of the introduction of a foreign world language on the vernaculars . the introduction of foreign official language has , in africa , led to explicit negative attitudes amongst the speakers themselves towards their languages . the alternative to the selection of an indigenous language as official language seems to be to disadvantage the whole population . in most african countries the foreign official language generally has a very low penetration so that only the elite know it . knowledge of the official language then becomes a new factor that determines access to power and the well-paid jobs . at the same time the vernaculars are ignored or stigmatised . this means that no or very little funds are available for their development and teaching . this means , to come back to tove skutnabb - kangas ' comments , that the population cannot exercise their "" right to learn their mother tongue , both orally and in writing , up to a high level . "" the assumption that frank ashen quotes is based on a false departure point , namely that only a colonial language can save an african country from being torn up by its own internal divisions . i do n't recall any wars based on language differences prior to colonisation . africa solved its linguistic diversity by developing lingua francas . djit ? recently ( 1993 ) showed that the use of so-called international languages such as english and french have not solved the communication problems of the african masses but in many cases contributed towards the "" pathology of linguistic bakwardness "" . the fact that these languages ( such as wolof , swahili , hausa , lingala ) are actually spreading - without much official help - seems to indicate "" a general willingness for cooperation and a cultural and linguistic tolerance that ignores the political boundaries inherited from colonization "" djit ? ( 1993 : 162 ) . spencer ( 1985 : 395 ) claims that the introduction of european languages to africa retarded the spread of what he calls "" african vehicular languages "" . however , adegbija ( 1994 : 26-27 ) is sceptical of the ability of african lingua francas of being accepted outside their present geographical domains . he also warns against the imposition of these languages . it would seem that we need a three-language policy such as that of india : one language for communication with the outside world known by a relatively small section of the population ; one lingua franca for national and regional communication and the various vernaculars for local business and primary education . in many african countries this is the de facto situation and trilingualism is more common in africa than outside linguists seem to realise . this suggestion might avoid the subtractive language learning ( that characterises many african communities ) and that tove skutnabb - kangas finds "" a violation of minorities ' linguistic rights "" . the sources that i referred to : adegbija , e . 1994 language attitudes in africa : a sociolinguistic overview . clevedon : multilingual matters . djit ? , p . g . 1993 "" language development in africa .

"Subject: review : cook : case grammar applied  walter a . cook . s . j . ( 1998 ) "" case grammar applied "" a publication of the summer institute of linguistics and the university of texas at arlington , 1998 , 271 pages reviewed by tania avgustinova , university of saarland . synopsis the book is intended as a companion volume to "" case grammar theory "" ( 1989 ) by the same author , and is devoted to the application of the model developed in this earlier publication to english text analysis . this in particular means that the main stress of the present work is on methodological issues , which are presented on an extended textual analysis of hamingway 's "" the old man and the sea "" . the actual goal of the discussed monograph is twofold : for the grammar - to present a method for sentence semantics which describes the meaning underlying each simple sentence ; for the lexicon - to present a method for further defining each sense of each verb / predicate in terms of semantic classes ( case-frame - based typology ) . each clause in its underlying structure is reduced to a kernel sentence which is defined as a simple complete active-voice affirmative statement . all texts are reduced to a sequence of kernel sentences the model used is the case grammar matrix model . it presents a clear predicate-argument structure , builds a lexicon which distinguishes various verb senses , and not only describes arguments occurring in the text , but through covert roles , describes implicit arguments . this model is supplemented by the use of conceptual graphs , following sowa ( 1984 ) . each verb type has a generalised conceptual graph to indicate the predicate-argument structure ; and each example in the text contains the canonical graph of that sentence using the verb and nouns as concepts , and case labels as the verb-to - noun relations . the book is organised in the following way . chapter 1 ( pp . 1-54 ) presents the case grammar matrix model in summary form and introduces conceptual graph representation . the next four chapters treat verbs / predicates in four distinguished semantic domains . chapter 2 ( pp . 55-90 ) deals with the basic domain that includes all state , process , and action verbs which use only the agent and object cases . chapter 3 ( pp . 91-126 ) deals with the experiential domain , the domain of sensation , emotion , cognition , and communication . it involves state , process , and action verbs which include an experiencer case in their descriptions . chapter 4 ( pp . 127-42 ) deals with the benefactive domain , the domain of possession and transfer of property , and describes state , process , and action verbs that include a benefactive case . chapter 5 ( pp . 143-82 ) deals with the locative domain , the domain of physical location and movement , and describes state , process , and action verbs that include a locative case . chapter 6 ( pp . 182-220 ) deals with other elements involved in the logical representation of sentences , including tense , aspect , modals , performatives , and negatives , showing how these elements may be included in the logical structure , and ending with a sample sentence parse using case grammar . chapter 7 ( pp . 221-46 ) summarises the analysis of more than 500 examples in chapters 2 through 5 and demonstrates the verbal hierarchy expressed by the twelve cells of the case grammar matrix , organised by verbal domain , verb type , and argument structure . each of the verb types is described together with its conceptual graph , its frequency of occurrence , its subtype , and its defining characteristics . the appendix to the text contains an alphabetical lexicon , listing all of the verbs / predicates in the examples together with their case frames ( pp . 247-52 ) , and a case lexicon , with the verbs sorted by case frame together with references for each verb to the pages where the use of the verb is exemplified ( pp . 253-60 ) . finally , there is a list of references ( pp . 261 - 6 ) , and an index ( pp . 267-71 ) . critical evaluation case grammar ( cg ) works with labelled predicate-argument structure , and thus , in its core , belongs to the dependency grammar paradigm . cg develops a semantic valence system that describes the logical form of a sentence in terms of a central predicate ( usually and typically a lexical verb , but also a predicate adjective , a predicate noun , or a predicate adverb ) and a series of case-labelled arguments ( nominal , adverbial ) required by the meaning of that predicate . so , the type of case considered in the book is ' governed case ' , and in fact , nothing is said about the way cg model would treat ' concordial case ' - cf . , e . g . , blake ( 1994 ) for a detailed discussion of these notions . there is no case concord in english and , hence , the challenges posited by ' concordial case ' are trivially out of the scope of the presented analysis ( which is based exclusively on english data ) . the ambition of the proponents of cg is to develop a semantic interpretation system that is universal across languages , and not tied to the syntax of any particular sentence . on the basis of the presented extensive data analysis it is claimed that the five case labels used in the work ( i . e . agent , object , experiencer , benefactive , and locative ) are necessary and sufficient for the description of all the verbs / predicates in the language ( in this case english ) . the possibility of creating different lists of cases is left open , whereby full translatability is theoretically expected between any consistent list of cases and the one employed in the cg matrix model . both the predicate and its arguments are viewed as concepts ( i . e . the conceptual universe is made up of verbs which describe states or events , and nouns which describe things ) , while the case role labels indicate relations ( which arguments bear to their predicates ) . cg is written in conceptual graph format by placing the concepts ( predicates , arguments ) in boxes and relations ( case roles ) in circles . the arrows in the notation point away from the predicate which is the source of the case relations . an advantage of such an approach is the possibility of defining the default position of the lexical predicate in its case frame , i . e . with respect to the arguments it governs . in the discussed book , a fairly credible ontology of predicators is achieved by hierarchically sorting them according to domain as basic , experiential , benefactive , locative , ( and possibly ) time , and within each domain as state , process , action . further sub-classification of the predicates is based on the number or the position of the arguments . the resulting hierarchical taxonomy is similar to a thesaurus in which all entities are organised into semantic domains . the organisation of the semantic domains is worked out in detail and with precision . the question of case inventory is central to cg , as well as to any theory working with the notion of case . also methodologically , a clear distinction must be made between essential cases , which are required by the meaning of the predicate , and modal case , which are mainly adverbial adjuncts . only essential cases can be used for describing predicates . despite of the lack of universal agreement on the number of case role labels or the way in which they are defined , the author gives a clear step-by step method , accompanied by various concrete tests , how to simplify in practice the case assignment . thus , the labelling is deferred until three basic questions are answered : how many arguments are required by the verb ? what verb type - state , process , or action - is in the structure ? to what semantic domain does the verb belong ? then , the naming of the arguments can be simplified by a set of principles , in combination with a set of tactics for the formation of case frames . within case frames , cases are listed left-to - right according to a subject choice hierarchy ( agent - experiencer - benefactive - object - locative ) which is merely a generalisation covering the unmarked choice . marked choices which violate the subject choice hierarchy are indicated in the lexicon by changing the order of cases in the case frame . possible variations involve "" equatives "" ( in copular constructions ) , regarded in this model as double - object frames in the basic domain , and rank shifts in the subject choice hierarchy . in the lexicon , predicators are classified according to case frames . the case frame is understood as a configuration of one to three cases that are required by the meaning of the verb ( or more generally , the predicate ) . let us remind , however , that , in lexical semantics research , cases are known where the frame would contain up to five slots . a famous example is the verb ' to rent ' ( russian : arendovat ' - cf . apresjan ( 1974 ) p . 134 ) involving the following arguments : ( 1 ) who , ( 2 ) what , ( 3 ) from whom , ( 4 ) for how much , ( 5 ) for how long . special attention is devoted to the possibility of lexicon organisation in terms of derivations intended both to represent linguistic generalisations and to simplify the lexicon ( sections 1 . 13 - 1 . 15 ) . however , the method followed in the work is listing each item separately and supplementing the lexicon with redundancy rules that relate these lexical entries to each other . also , each sense of each predicate is treated as a separate item with its own case frame . in order to set the guidelines for applied cg textual analysis , a concise introduction to the principles of lexical decomposition and to the interpretation of covert case roles is given . lexical decomposition is understood as the process of analysing predicates as consisting of more basic atomic predicates . with some sentences this is unavoidable for determining the actual predicate-argument structure . covert case roles , which are required by the meaning of the predicate , are sometimes ( as in the case of partially covert ( deletable ) case roles ) or always ( as in the case of totally covert ( coreferential and lexicalised ) case roles ) missing in the surface structure . since the cg analysis advocated for in this book maintains the obligatory object hypothesis , covert roles assume greater importance . in all cases where the object role can be sometimes deleted , or can be coreferential with another role , or can be lexicalised into the predicate , a deeper analysis is needed to find the obligatory object . certainly , the lexicalisation of the manifestation of propositional , essential roles is of primary interest in the context of revealing the central predicate in a sentence . the assumption that a predicate , even with covert ( hidden ) case role , has to be defined in terms of its full complement of case roles requires a clear distinction between deletable , coreferential and lexicalised roles . the author offers in this respect not only theoretical background but also concrete tests , procedures and instructions to guide and facilitate practical analysis . two methodological principles are postulated ensuring that all conceptual relations flow from the central verb , and that deletable roles are included in case descriptions . a major asset of the book is , with no doubt , the extensive textual analysis performed with precision , consistency and conformity to the postulated principles and theoretical assumptions . the limits of the approach are realistically recognised by the author , and are stated explicitly in the appropriate places throughout the presentation . the reader will find a well-developed and detailed ontology of predicates , which covers not only verbs but also predicative adjectives , predicative nouns and predicative adverbs . the most important linguistic phenomena are considered in a systematic and easy-to - follow way . this makes the book a valuable guide to a practical sentence analysis , as well as a useful reference material for research purposes and computer applications . references apresjan , jurij d . 1974 : leksicheskaja semantika . sinonimicheskie sredstva jazyka . moskva : nauka blake , barry j . 1994 : case . cambridge textbooks in linguistics . cook , walter a . , s . j . 1989 : case grammar theory . washington , d . c . : georgetown university press . sowa , john f . 1984 : conceptual graphs : information processing in mind and machine . reading , mass . : addison -

Subject: comparative method : n - ary comparison again  some time ago , while we were discussing comparative linguistics , the question was raised ( by bill poser , i think ) of whether anybody ever claims in print that binary comparison is preferable to n-ary comparison . while i cited one reference at that time , i thought it might be still be of general interest to adduce one more , which has just come to my attention . in his attack on the theory that japanese is altaic ( and on altaic as a whole ) , janhunen 1992 argues that the odds of finding apparent matches simply by chance when japanese is compared to the four altaic languages / subgroups , viz . , turkic , mongolic , tungusic , and korean , are four times as high as are the odds of finding such spurious matches when japanese is compared to just one language , specifically korean ( which is singled out by janhunen because there has been a fair amount of work on japanese - korean comparison which ignored altaic ) . in other words , janhunen assumes that a 5 - ary comparison is four times as likely to produce matches purely by chance ( what i call ' false positives ' ) as is a binary comparison . this , needless to say , is a fallacy , but there you have it . janhunen , juha . 1992 . das japanische in vergleichender sicht . journal de la soci t finno - ougrienne 84 . 145-161 . 	0

"Subject: the ipa market  "" alexis mr "" urges that phonetic alphabets be standardized , and writes , "" why not let the invisible hand of the "" market "" of ideas operate freely ? "" but the market * is * operating . that 's exactly why we have several different systems , any that 's why people feel free to modify those systems as they please . i do not see how the market would demand i asked in an earlier egram ( vol-6 - 199 ) why it would benefit me , as an active fieldworker , to have a completely revamped phonetic alphabet . i am still waiting for a plausible answer . i am happy with ipa most of the time , and when i ' m not i innovate as necessary . a complete overhaul would be wrenching for me and probably leave me feeling extremely alientated . more likely , i would just go on using the ipa and chinese ipa symbols i already use , and the dubious goal of a new , unified standard phonetic system would fail . i think the real reason some people want to overhaul ipa is to alter its aesthetics - to make it neater , more symmetrical somehow . i do not see any practical value in this . nor do i see any need to have a single , unified system , replacing both ipa and american consensual practice . everybody recognizes esh , and everybody recognizes s-hachek , and if a letter _ y _ appears in a transcription you look carefully at the introduction and find out what it represents , that 's all . where is the problem ? please , someone tell me , where is the problem ? david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 ( charmii @ u . washington . edu ) "	0

Subject: subcategorization in tranformational grammar  dear colleagues , i ' m wondering if someone could give me some pointers to the latest literature in transformational grammar ( gb , p&p , minimalism ) that deals with issues of subcategorization . in particular i would like to get a sense of the latest thinking , including ways in which minimalism departs from previous assumptions . among the questions that i would ideally like to see addressed are the following : - what kind of subcategorization relations have been assumed in the recent literature , and for what kinds of phenomena ? for instance , a transitive verb must somehow encode the requirement of taking a dp complement . but can a verb also take a pp complement according to the identity of that pp 's head ( as in _ rely _ + _ on _ ) ? - how are subcategorization relations constrained ? that is , what syntactic ( or semantic ) properties are thought to be accessible ( in the limit ) to the selecting head ? - if there are substantive formal constraints on subcategorization , where do they come from ? is there anything in the architecture of the theory from which such constraints would follow ? thanks very much , - - andreas kathol 	0

"" the name of the region is galicia and is part of spain . galician is a language "" much older than spanish itself : it was used for poetry and by the kings in "" ancient times . still , we do not hear a lot about galician separatism . neither "" do we hear anything about leonese separatism , aragonese separatism , andalusian "" separatism , simply because it does not exist . separatism on the peninsula has "" nothing to do with language . it has everything to do with historic rights of "" old kingdoms . galician separatism exists . it just simply does n't reach the news because galician separatists ( a minority ) have n't killed people , even though they ' ve tried to on a couple of occasions . on the contrary , galician separatists ( and federalists ) have been killed by the spanish army and police ( during franco 's uprising and regime ) . there are galician separatists in the jails of the spanish kingdom . the spiral of stret and institutional violence is benefitial to the western democratic states . separatism in the iberian peninsula , as elsewhere , has to do with the way peoples view ( or are led to view ) their own identity in opposition to other identities . language is most often , if not always , an issue . as for galiza , to the extent that the spanish state is able to keep the lid on the language issue by taming the language of galiza ( portuguese ) and turning it into a domestic "" galician "" , no problem - - galiza won't reach the news . galiza , as many other minorized cultures of the world , is caught between two states : spain and portugal . what the kingdom of spain and , particularly , its representatives in galiza ( the majority of the local political and intellectual elites ) can't cope with is the fact that another state 's language , portuguese , is spoken ( and written as such , by a small fraction of the elites ) within spanish territory . legislative , administrative , and judicial measures have been taken to silence some intellectuals , writers , and teachers who support , with rational arguments , the view that "" galician "" is just a set of regional and social varieties of portuguese , and therefore it should be written with the portuguese orthography . these acts of actual repression , discrimination and censorship by the mechanisms of the spanish state do n't reach the news either . the situation of the "" language question "" in galiza nowadays is the furthest one could imagine from a civilized , technical and political debate on how to articulate and reconcile galician identity / ies with galiza 's language . it is discouraging and worrisome to see how the term "" reintegrationist "" , which refers to those who seek the effective recognition of galician as a part of its natural linguistic domain , portuguese , is being thrown around as an insult in public and academic discourse . i should clarify that the separatist / reintegrationist lines intersect each other . that is , there are galician separatists or nationalists who are reintegrationists and use the portuguese orthography , and then there are other separatists and nationalists who are very happy with the institutionally-supported view of galician as a "" separate language "" to be written , however , with a spanish - based orthography . in the meantime , galician portuguese is being learned less and less as a first language . but that 's not the real issue . celso alvarez - caccamo lxalvarz @ udc . es "	0

"Subject: re : your requested info  thank you for your interest in our training course . success courses offers an extensive video tape training course in "" how to collect judicial judgments "" . if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a judicial judgment is and why processing judicial judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a judicial judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact : "" its now up to you to collect on the judgment "" . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . "" in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . "" the non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected judicial judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 4 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed in this profession . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing judicial judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of judicial judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operate out of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today success courses and our associates have over 632 million dollars in judicial judgments that we are currently processing . of this 632 million , 36 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid judicial judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non-confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor does n't know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful judicial processing are as follows : mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with judicial judgments . ( we train you how to find out who to write to ) 8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you do n't call them unless you want to . you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and 50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 . you then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $ 25 . 00 . once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course ) when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to the original judgment holder . once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . ( included in the course ) quote 's from several of our students : thomas in area code 516 writes us : "" i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and the video opened doors for me in the future . there 's no stopping me now . as of february 3rd , 1995 , thomas states he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on . after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code 314 stated to us : "" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now . "" after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated "" i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately $ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i will have to hire someone to help out "" marshal in area code 407 states to us "" i feel bad , you only charged me $ 189 . 00 for this course and it is a gold mine . i have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months "" > from the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following : with our course you can own your own successful business . a business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to retire on and travel the world . a business which is extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every day is new and exciting . none of your days will be hum drum . your brain is challenged . a business which protects you from corporate downsizing . a business which you can start part time from your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full time . a business which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do . a business which lets you control your own destiny . our training has made this happen for many others already . make it happen for you ! if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being , no cost or obligation on your part . please call us at 1-500 - 488-2035 . we have customer support staff available to you from 7 : 00am to 7 : 00pm ( pacific time ) monday through saturday . closed sunday . if you call this number you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel . they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation . sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations of courses . when you call our customer support line they can let you know of any specials we may be running . if you like what you read and hear about our courses , then the customer support person can work with you to place your order . we are very low key . we merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to work with us or not . thank you for your time and interest . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + another internet ad campaign produced and distributed by : cyber advertising systems , ny , ny 10011 . please call cyber advertising systems at 1-800 - 409-8302 extension 1284 if you would like us to design and distribute powerful advertising for your company . success courses is pleased with the advertising we have developed for them . if you have a solid well proven product or service then we would be proud to help your company also . if you would like to be removed from cyber advertising systems mailing list then please send an email to : lernerww223 @ yahoo . com and type remove in the subject line . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + % + "	1

to - liquids ( gtl ) technology gtl is carbon 's revolutionary process for converting the natural gas released during oil production or existing stranded reserves into clean-burning synthetic fuels , which have a $ 7 to $ 10 per barrel premium over conventional fuels . because this process is approximately 30 % less expensive than competing gtl processes and due to mounting political , regulatory and tax pressures on oil and gas companies to help reduce the level of atmospheric co2 ( formed in the atmosphere from released natural gas ) , these companies may now have greatly increased incentive to utilize carbon 's gtl process on a worldwide scale . licensings in the next ten years from just one percent of the current gtl market is estimated to be $ 220 to $ 440 million . heavy oil upgrading carbon owns a 50 percent interest in a proprietary technology that converts so-called heavy oils into lighter oils , which , at current market value , sell for about $ 15 per barrel , twice the price of heavy oils . the current market for heavy oil is now 4 . 5 million barrels per day , six percent of worldwide oil production . many experts believe this market will increase to 25 percent of worldwide oil production by the year 2015 . penetration of only 3 . 5 percent of the current market over the next ten years is anticipated to produce licensing and royalties of at least $ 60 million and could , under most favorable market conditions , reach $ 300 million . microturbine fuel based on recent tests , carbon 's syngen reactor ( a patented and proprietary first phase gtl component ) cheaply and efficiently gasifies crude oil , producing fuel that can be used in microturbines and boilers by oil companies to decrease the cost of power in oil production by eliminating the need for an outside power source . analysts expect the current potential microturbine market to grow by at least 25 percent per year for the foreseeable future . -

- get those teeth capped ! ! - even retire ! this is your chance , so please do n't pass it up ! please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity ! ! ! my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that costs me pennies to produce and email . i should also point out again that this mlm program is legal and every person who participates will make money . you are offering a legitimate valuable and useful product to your customers . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it 's simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four 4 financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in many other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail or email this program . by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free !

( apart from time on air ) report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . the best method of sending the purchased reports back to your customers is by email ! ! all purchasers should be certain to include their email addresses to receive their reports ! ! best wishes with the program and good luck ! remember : approx . 200 , 000 new people get online weekly ! you will never ever run out of potential customers ! order your reports now ! ! ! you will not believe the income potential ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a personal note from the originator of this program . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for many years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession has now replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what has happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there have been more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the age of computerization has added to jobs disappearing also . the middle class is vanishing . those who know what they are doing invest wisely and move up . those who do not , including those who have never had anything to save or invest , are moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation and deflation and taxation will also see to that . you have just received information that can give you some financial freedom , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort .

remember , the more you send out , the more potential customers you will reach . it is a pure numbers business ! ! so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials , and opportunity to become financially better off . it is up to you now - think about it - your total risk is only $ 20 ? ? ? ? !

it 's been wonderful . carl winslow tulsa , ok the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . initially i let no one in the organization know that i was an attorney and , to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown this plan works like gang-busters !

g . bank not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n't get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy i was surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders . after that it got so over-loaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i ' ll make more money this year than any years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n't matter where in the u . s . or the world for that matter , the people live . there simply is n't a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n't delete this one !

Subject: workshop annoncement and call for papers - clitics  workshop announcement and call for papers c l i t i c s 24th - 26th february 1999 konstanz university , germany we are pleased to announce our workshop on ' clitics ' during the 21st annual meeting of the german society of linguistics in konstanz ( germany ) . in linguistic research , clitics play an increasingly prominent role . the status of clitics is under discussion in phonology , morphology , and syntax , as well as in the respective interfaces . in these fields , the discussion on clitics gives rise to controversial analyses . one open question is whether we need in fact a separate linguistic category ' clitic ' , or whether these elements can be subsumed under different linguistic categories , such as affixes . - with respect to phonology , it is undetermined how clitics are incorporated into phonological structure . should we distinguish a clitic group in the prosodic hierarchy , are clitics part of prosodic words , or are they left outside prosodic structure ? how is their phonological deficiency best accounted for ? - concerning the morphology of clitics , especially regarding the occurrence of opaque clitics in clitic clusters , analyses within the framework of distributed morphology compete with those which propose an optimality theoretic solution . - also , the morphosyntactic status of clitics is unclear . is it possible to capture the order of clitics in clitic clusters in a more explanatory way than in terms of templates ? the complex conditions on clitic doubling give rise to the question whether clitics should be analysed as agreement markers or as arguments . - syntactic aspects of clitics play a major role in recent analyses in different theoretical frameworks . for instance , there is no agreement on the explanation of clitic climbing and it is an unsettled issue whether clitic placement should be accounted for in a syntactic , prosodic , prosodic-syntactic , or optimality-theoretic approach . the workshop intends to bring together phonologists , morphologists , and syntacticians and provides an ideal opportunity to share insights and to discuss the issues mentioned above . in addition to the invited speaker presentations , there are 9 slots for 30 - minute presentations , and 3 slots for 1 hour presentations ( including discussion ) . invited speakers : geert booij ( free university amsterdam ) jane grimshaw ( rutgers university ) juan uriagereka ( university of maryland ) please send a one-page abstract before 15th august 1998 to : birgit gerlach & janet grijzenhout , seminar fuer allgemeine sprachwissenschaft , heinrich - heine - universitaet , universitaetsstr . 1 , 40225 duesseldorf , germany . we may be contacted by e-mail at gerlach @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de , or grijzenh @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de 	0

"Subject: review massaro 1998  massaro , d . w . ( 1998 ) . perceiving talking faces : from speech perception to a behavioral principle ( mit press , cambridge , mass . ) . 552 pp . , 212 illus . , 1 cd-rom . $ 55 . 00 . reviewed byl noel nguyen , laboratory for psycholinguistics , fpse , university of geneva , switzerland ( nnguyen @ fapse . unige . ch ) . 1 synopsis 1 . 1 general outline this book is concerned with how multiple sources of information are processed in speech perception and , more generally , in pattern recognition . it is based upon an important research programme conducted by massaro and his colleagues over the last two decades . the book focuses on the perception of so-called bimodal speech , addressing a wide range of issues about the way in which visual information ( as provided by the speaker 's face ) and auditory information are combined with each other by the perceptual system . the scope of the book is much larger , however , as massaro 's purpose here is to describe and defend a new psychological law relevant to a wide variety of domains . in contrast to already well-established laws of the same kind ( e . g . weber 's law of perception ) , which are all unidimensional , the new principle is multidimensional , in that it describes how several factors impact behaviour . this principle is embodied in a computational model of pattern recognition , the fuzzy logical model of perception ( flmp ) , whose latest version is presented and discussed in detail . the flmp is systematically contrasted with alternative computational models , using a broad perceptual database as benchmark throughout the book . in a separate part , the book also deals with methods for synthesizing talking faces in experiments on bimodal speech perception , and introduces baldi , the talking face developed by massaro and his coworkers . the book is accompanied by a cd-rom which contains a series of demonstrations relating to many of the topics dealt with . the book is divided into four main sections . section 1 , "" perceiving talking faces "" , focuses on the perception of speech by ear and eye . massaro reviews the most significant empirical findings in that domain , discusses the main methodological issues , and presents a general classification of the existing computational models of bimodal speech perception . central to this section is the idea that speech perception obeys a general behavioural principle of integration between different sources of information . section 2 , "" broadening the domain "" , aims at assessing how well this principle holds up across broad individual and situational variability . the author demonstrates that inter-individual variations in how bimodal speech is perceived , depending on the listener 's age or native language for instance , can be accounted for within the flmp framework . using examples taken from different perceptual and cognitive situations , massaro also defends the idea that the flmp adequately describes information processing irrespective of these situational differences . section 3 , "" broadening the framework "" , opens with a presentation of an extended and more explicit version of the flmp , designed in particular to account for the dynamics of speech processing . the section also includes a detailed analysis of the methodological issues involved in assessing quantitative predictions in psychology , along with a discussion of the critiques expressed by other investigators about the flmp over the years . finally , section 4 , "" creating talking faces "" , is specifically dedicated to the synthesis of visual speech . 1 . 2 the new behavioural principle although many readers may already be familiar with massaro 's fuzzy logical model of perception , i shall here assume the contrary , and proceed to present a brief outline of the model . a central assumption of the flmp is that pattern recognition involves a common set of processes regardless of the specific nature of the patterns . speech is not seen as being associated with a dedicated processing module , as in the motor theory of speech perception ( liberman , 1996 ) for instance . on the contrary , the sensory information is assumed to be processed in the same way whether our brain is busy recognizing speech sounds , letters , or manual gestures , to take but a few examples . in any of these cases , the flmp postulates that mapping a stimulus into a unique perceptual category entails going through three main stages of processing , the feature evaluation stage , the feature integration stage , and the decision stage . the evaluation stage consists of converting the available sources of information into a set of properties referred to as features . each feature is given a continuous ( fuzzy truth ) value , and represents the degree to which the stimulus corresponds to each of a set of internal prototypical patterns , along a particular perceptual dimension . thus , one important visual feature in the perception of cv syllables is the degree of opening of the lips . the model therefore assumes that the internal prototypes available to the perceptual system will specify that the lips are open at the onset of the syllable for / da / , closed for / ba / , etc . in a second stage , the features are integrated with each other , so as to determine the overall degree of match of the sensory input with each of the prototypes ( e . g . each of the syllables known to the receiver ) . in the third and final stage , a decision is taken , on the basis of the relative goodness of match of the input with each prototype . the flmp makes a number of specific assumptions at each stage in this process . first , it hypothesizes that all of the available sources of information are simultaneously brought into play in pattern recognition . thus , visible speech and auditory speech are both assumed to have an influence on how bimodal speech is perceived . second , different sources of information are assumed to be evaluated independently of each other . this means for example that visible speech does not have any effect on how auditory speech is converted into a set of features , the two sources of information being combined at a later stage of processing only . the model also makes specific assumptions about how sources of information are integrated with each other ( multiplicative rule ) , and about how decisions are taken ( relative goodness rule ) . a major prediction of the model is that "" the influence of one source of information is greatest when the other source is neutral or ambiguous "" ( 19 ) . this prediction is best illustrated by an experiment whose results served as a database for testing models of pattern recognition on several occasions in the book ( chapters 2 and 11 ) . in this experiment , synthetic auditory stimuli ranging on a continuum between / ba / and / da / were crossed with visual stimuli also varying between / ba / and / da / . the bimodal stimuli were presented to subjects in a forced-choice identification task , along with each of the unimodal stimuli . ( this expanded factorial design is shown by massaro to be the most appropriate experimental design for determining how two sources of information are combined with each other in pattern recognition . ) for the bimodal stimuli , the main results are typically depicted as a two-factor plot , with the proportion of / da / responses on the ordinate , the levels of the auditory source of information on the abscissa , and a different curve for each of the levels of the visual source of information . when represented in that way , the results clearly show a statistical interaction between the two sources of information . specifically , the influence of one source of information proves to be larger in the middle , ambiguous range of the other source . this interaction graphically takes the shape of an american football , which is for this reason presented throughout the book as the hallmark of the the fuzzy logical model of perception . in summary , massaro proposes a universal principle of perceptual cognitive performance to explain pattern recognition . according to this principle , "" people are influenced by multiple sources of information in a diverse set of situations . in many cases , these sources of information are ambiguous and any particular source alone does not usually specify the appropriate interpretation . the perceiver appears to evaluate the multiple sources of information in parallel for the degree to which each supports various interpretations , integrate them together to derive the overall support for each interpretation , assess the support of each alternative based on all of the alternatives , and select the most appropriate response . "" ( p . 291 ) . 2 critical evaluation 2 . 1 general evaluation this book is clearly a major contribution to the study of speech perception and , more generally , to cognitive psychology . it is admirably clear and is written in quite an elegant manner . i do not doubt that the book will be read with great interest by research scientists from many different fields . this work is the result of an ambitious intellectual endeavour aimed at introducing a new behavioural law , which is placed by massaro on an equal footing with weber 's law of perception , or the power law of learning . speech scientists are presented with an extensive series of experiments on the perception of bimodal speech . whatever stance they take in that domain , they should find quite challenging massaro 's view that speech perception constitutes but one aspect of a much more general form of cognitive processing , namely pattern recognition . computer scientists working in the field of speech technology should be particularly interested in the book 's final section about the synthesis of visual speech . regardless of their background , readers should also find the book worth using as a tutorial on the experimental methods available for investigating speech perception . a great variety of experimental paradigms and tasks are discussed at length by massaro , who also extensively discusses the methods for assessing computational models of pattern recognition and , in particular , for fitting these models to observed results . in that respect , using the results of the experiment described above as a reference database was quite a good initiative in my view , as this allows the reader more easily to understand massaro 's point as new issues are raised , without having again to go through the details of the experimental design each time . the book should also prove an invaluable resource for teaching . care was taken to select prototypical results , as well as to set this work in its historical context . a number of rather fascinating anecdotes and historical references are given , going from mcgurk 's personal account of the discovery of the mcgurk effect , to an audio-visual rendition of the introduction to george miller 's seminal article on the ubiquitousness of the number 7 plus or minus 2 , with miller 's face texture-mapped onto baldi 's wire-frame head . the cd-rom that accompanies the book enables the reader directly to experience the psychological illusions associated with the perception of bimodal speech , and constitutes as such a most useful research and teaching tool . on the negative side , massaro 's use of the / ba / - / da / experiment as a leading strand throughout obviously results in the book being focused on the perception of non-sense syllables . although the interaction of visible speech and audible speech in word recognition is mentioned on a number of occasions ( e . g . pp 21-23 and pp . 181-182 ) , the book contains few suggestions as to how we perceive isolated words , let alone connected speech . i also was surprised by the fact that little place was devoted to presenting other current theories and models of speech perception . although models such as trace are mentioned on several occasions in the book , i think it is fair to say that the flmp is still given the lion 's share . the book also has some minor defects such as the absence of a list of figures , and the fact that some of the cd-rom bands ( 1 . 4 , 1 . 5 and 1 . 6 ) are referred to incorrectly in the text . the list of the cd-rom selections should have pointed to the pages where each band is referred to . in another domain , it would have been quite interesting to have the perceptual database used in the book made available on the cd-rom . although this would have probably required a substantial amount of additional work , i should also have found it useful to be provided with an interactive version of the main computational models discussed in the book ( flmp , the race model , the single channel model , etc . ) . the flmp model can be downloaded from massaro 's laboratory web site at santa cruz ( http : / / mambo . ucsc . edu ) , but it is currently distributed in fortran code which has to be modified and recompiled for each new set of data , an operation which is probably out of reach of many students in psychology or linguistics . 2 . 2 specific comments i am not familiar with all of the areas dealt with in this book , and will not hide the fact that this review is biased towards my own interests , namely the production and perception of auditory speech . the following comments more specifically concentrate on two issues relating to this area of research , the role of features in speech processing and the time course of speech processing . 2 . 2 . 1 features most useful are the extensive comments made by massaro about the status of features in his model ( see in particular chapter 2 and chapter 10 ) . i long have found it difficult to determine how close these features were to classical phonetic features . the book makes it clear to me that there is no direct relation between the former and the latter . as indicated above , the flmp postulates that there are three main stages of processing in pattern recognition : the feature evaluation stage , the feature integration stage , and the decision stage . specific assumptions are made in the model about how features are integrated with each other , and how a decision is taken depending on the outcome of this integration . from a set of feature values , therefore , the model will predict the probability of occurrence of each possible response ( e . g . "" ba "" and "" da "" ) . however , attention should be paid to the fact that these feature values are in no way derived from the stimulus . they are actually determined in an posteriori manner , from the subjects ' observed responses , using an algorithm ( stepit ) which allows the deviation between these responses and the predicted ones to be minimal . features are seen in the model as * free parameters * , whose values are set on the basis of the actual performance of the subject in the pattern recognition task , so as to make the model perform at its best , i . e . to maximize its goodness of fit . according to massaro , "" [ the model is ] * predicting * the exact * form * of the results , but * postdicting * the actual quantitative * values * that make up the overall predictions "" ( p . 294 , his emphasis ) . in other words , the stimulus is on no occasion explicitly mapped onto the internal features of the flmp model . in that respect , features as defined in the flmp look markedly different from phonetic features . let us take for example the opposition between / ba / and / da / , on which much emphasis is put in the book . acoustically , / b / and / d / are said to differ from each other according to the feature grave-acute , / b / being classified as grave and / d / as acute . as is the case with flmp features , grave and acute can be viewed as target values referring to prototypical stops . however , the grave-acute feature is explicitly defined in acoustical terms ( e . g . slope of the short-term spectrum at the release of the stop , see stevens & blumstein , 1978 ) . on the contrary , the exact nature of the flmp features remains undetermined , their values being subject to one main constraint which is to make the model account for the subjects ' responses as accurately as possible . thus , the acoustic structure of the stimulus is not directly taken into consideration in the estimation of the feature values . in the experiments using audible speech , flmp features do lend themselves to an acoustic interpretation . in the / ba / - / da / experiment for example , the prototypes for / ba / and / da / are assumed to include one auditory feature , namely the variations in frequency of the second ( f2 ) and third ( f3 ) formants at the onset of the vowel ( slightly falling f2-f3 for / da / , rising f2-f3 for / ba / ) . however , this interpretation stems from the fact that f2 and f3 onset frequencies were precisely the acoustic parameters manipulated by the experimenters to synthesize the auditory continuum between / ba / and / da / . in other words , the acoustic significance of the flmp features is derived from the way in which the experiment has been designed . the model does rely on a particular system of acoustic features ( see for example stevens & blumstein , 1978 , for an alternative system ) , but this system is embodied in the experimental design , and is as such external to the model itself . in practice , therefore , the issue of how speech sounds are mapped onto features is not addressed in the model . why this is so is not clear to me . on several occasions , massaro suggests that determining in advance how a given individual will convert a given stimulus into a set of feature values is simply out of our reach . this stimulus-to - feature mapping shows a variability which is said to be analogous to the variability of the weather : there are just too many previous contributions and influences to allow quantitative prediction ( 135 ) . a fundamental distinction is in fact established in the flmp between the intake of * information * , i . e . the stimulus-to - feature mapping , and * information processing * , i . e . how features are combined with each other and mapped into a response ( cf . p . 135 ) . while the flmp predicts that the information will be processed in the same way from one individual to the other , regardless of whether it relates to speech sounds , facial movements , manual gestures , etc . , it is assumed that the way in which this information is extracted from the stimulus is on the contrary subject to too many sources of variations to be accurately characterized ahead of time . in my understanding , this means that the so-called evaluation stage cannot be accounted for by the model , or at least not with much accuracy . however , at least on one occasion massaro does suggest that this limitation is not consubstantial with every model of perception and pattern recognition , and could be circumvented in some way . according to him , one could indeed "" easily hypothesize functions relating the feature values to the stimulus levels , [ although ] that would represent a * model of information * in addition to one of information processing "" ( 294 , my emphasis ) . this suggests that building such a model of information is feasible . whether there is a possibility of the flmp being completed with a model of this kind , i . e . an explicit stimulus-to - feature mapping stage , is an issue which remains to be addressed . 2 . 2 . 2 the time course of speech processing time plays quite a central role in different ways in the book . first , massaro shows how the flmp can be explicitly formalized to account for the dynamics of perceptual processing ( chap . 9 ) . this formalization is presented in reply to criticisms expressed by a number of investigators ( e . g . mcclelland , 1991 ) , who have pointed out that the flmp accurately characterizes the asymptotic outcome of the perceptual system ( e . g . the probability for a particular response to occur ) , but has little to say about the time course of processing . the dynamic version of the flmp is intended to address these reactions . in this version , the stimulus-to - feature mapping is assumed to take a certain amount of time . during this interval , the information about the stimulus gradually accumulates , and becomes increasingly accurate . it is assumed that accuracy increases as a negatively accelerated function of processing time , so that more information is gleaned early than late in the processing of the stimulus . one further assumption is that "" integration of the separate features [ is ] updated continuously as the featural information is being evaluated . similarly , decision [ can ] occur at any time after the stimulus presentation "" ( 259 ) . thus , there is a partial temporal overlap between the different stages of processing , in the sense that one process can begin before a previous process is finished ( see also figure 2 . 1 , p . 41 ) . these assumptions about the time course of information processing are supported by a number of experiments concerned with the effect of backward masking in the recognition of pure tones , and in the recognition of letters . speech obviously raises a number of specific issues in that domain , however . unlike written words , speech is a temporal phenomenon , it is continuous ( i . e . there are no systematic acoustic boundaries between phonemes , syllables , or words ) and , furthermore , time per se serves as a source of information in speech , as pointed out by massaro ( e . g . vowel duration is a major cue to the voicing of the following obstruent , to take but one example ) . somewhat regrettably , few indications are given about how the model could be assessed in the speech domain ( see remarks p . 194 and p . 263 ) . in addition to discussing the dynamics of processing , massaro examines how the temporal relations between sources of information are dealt with in pattern recognition . chapter 3 focuses on our sensitivity to temporal asynchronies between visible and audible speech . in the experiments reported in this chapter , bimodal cv syllables with various degrees of onset asynchrony between the auditory synthetic speech and the visible synthetic speech were presented to subjects in a forced-choice identification task . the results show that integration between the two sources of information still occurs when these sources of information are made asynchronous , provided that the time shift does not exceed a certain duration . one major challenge for phoneticians and psycholinguists alike is to characterize the relationship between what could be called the * external * dynamics of speech , i . e . the temporal organization of the speech signal , and the * internal * time course of speech processing . both play a role in the perception of speech , and it is most difficult to tell apart their respective influences on the listener 's behaviour ( samuel , 1996 ) . for example , in a gating study investigating the role of vowel duration as a cue to the voicing of the post-vocalic stop in cvc syllables , warren and marslen - wilson ( 1988 ) found that the proportion of voiced-coda responses increased as the listeners were presented with increasingly long portions of the initial cv sequence . one obvious interpretation is that longer vowels were perceived as being associated with voiced coda rather than voiceless ones . in keeping with massaro 's dynamical flmp , however , it may also be assumed that evaluating the information provided by the vowel takes time , and that the evidence pointing to a voiced coda gradually accumulates as more processing time is made available to the listener , all other things being equal . thus , the above finding raises the issue of how to differentiate the effect of vowel duration per se on the listener 's response , from that of the internal dynamics of processing . although this issue is not directly addressed in the book , there is no doubt that the flmp would constitute a most appropriate framework for further investigations in this domain . 2 . 3 general conclusion this book provides us with quite an extensive review of the work carried out by the author and others on the use of multiple cues in speech perception and , more generally , pattern recognition . it is aimed at a very large audience , and constitutes a most useful tool both for teaching and research purposes . i do not doubt that it will soon become a major reference for researchers in phonetics , psycholinguistics , and cognitive psychology . 4 bibliography liberman , a . m .
