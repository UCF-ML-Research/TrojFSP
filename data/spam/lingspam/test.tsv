"Subject: summary on anglicization of names  hi - i posted a query a while ago about how non - english names get anglicized . what i got in response was quite interesting , though most of it was anecdotal , as the responders themselves noted . most of the research cited was not in sociolinguistics but in speech technology . i still think this would be an interesting topic to work on . in any case , i ' m including the responses i got , with thanks to all and apologies for the typographical irregularities - best , larry rosenwald , wellesley college 1 ) > from margaret luebs < maluebs @ umich . edu > i saw your message on the linguist list and wanted to share a story with you ( probably not scholarly enough for your summary , though ) . my last name is german and is spelled "" luebs "" . people always assume it is pronounced "" lubes "" which is pretty close to the expected german pronunciation ( though that may not have been how my great-grandparents said it ; see below ) . instead , irritatingly enough , we say "" lebbs "" . the story i ' ve been told ( which may be partly apocryphal ) is that when my grandfather ( the first of 12 siblings to make it off the farm that their parents settled on in the 1880 's ) arrived at the university of nebraska in 1910 , he went to a professor in the german department and asked "" what is the american pronunciation of my name ? "" ( because up till then his family had just pronounced it the old way - - they spoke german at home and lived among lots of other germans ) . the professor , for some reason , said "" lebbs "" so that 's what we got stuck with . then a few years later another brother made it to the university , and * he * went to a * different * professor in the german department and asked the same question . the answer he got was "" leebs "" so that 's how his descendants pronounce the name . other cousins seem to have just used their own common sense , because there are some out there who pronounce it "" lubes "" . however we have an old letter from germany addressed to my great-grandfather , and it refers to him as "" h . libs "" , ( a misspelling perhaps inspired by the actual pronunciation ) so the original pronunciation may have been closer to "" leebs "" . it still does n't explain "" lebbs "" , but oh well . i know this is n't what you asked for - - it 's not phonetic factors or even normal sociolinguistic ones , but rather the dreaded influence of university professors ! 2 ) > from lexo @ lsi . sel . sony . com ( lex olorenshaw ) hi , the anglicization topic interests me , too , but more from a speech technology point of view . for example , what ways can we anticipate the anglicized pronunciation of names in order to produce better synthesized speech , or to automatically recognize speech better ? some research has been done in this area for text - to - speech synthesizers . but i have n't looked into it too much . there are a couple of references to "" name pronunciation "" on this web site that might serve as a starting point - http : / / www . bellcore . com / orator / oref . html since i ' ve been wondering about this , i also did a quick search for "" name pronunciation "" in linguistics abstract online ( currently on a free trial basis ! ) , and came up with the following items - - - - - - - - - - - title : variant grapheme-phoneme correspondences in unfamiliar polysyllabic words author : robert l . trammell journal : language and speech vol : 33 ( 4 ) , 1990 , 293-323 subdiscipline : phonology abstract : ten college students and ten phds read aloud 30 unfamiliar english words , two to five syllables in length , of greek , latin , and germanic origin . the average number of different subject pronunciations per word was five ( range one to ten ) . each response was compared to the rule-predicted , dictionary-prescribed , and most frequent pronunciation for that word . the subjects agreed more with each other than with the dictionary , and with the latter more than with the rules . however , the rules predicted half of the prescribed pronunciations , which was better than the average number of individual subject ` s responses agreeing with the dictionary . the most frequent response to each word demonstrated considerably more agreement with both the dictionary and the rules than did the average number of responses for the subjects individually . the etymological source of the test words had no effect . while the phds as a group did significantly better than the students on most measures , the differences were small . in view of previous research , the frequent vowel laxing in open third and fourth syllables from the end was unexpected . several models of reading are examined in the light of these results . - - - - - - - - - title : novel - word pronunciation : a cross-language study author : k . p . h sullivan & r . i . damper journal : speech communication vol : 13 ( 3 - 4 ) , 1993 , 441-452 subdiscipline : computational linguistics abstract : in the case of a ' novel word ' absent from a text-to - speech system ` s pronouncing dictionary , traditional systems invoke context-dependent letter-to - phoneme rules to produce a pronunciation . a proposal in the psychological literature , however , is that human readers pronounce novel words not by using explicit rules , but by analogy with letter-to - phoneme patterns for words they already know . in this paper , a synthesis-by - analogy system is presented which is , accordingly , also a model of novel-word pronunciation by humans . it employs analogy in both orthographic and phonological domains and is applied here to the pronunciation of novel words in british ( received pronunciation ) english and german . in implementing the system , certain detailed questions were confronted which analogy theory is at present inadequately developed to answer . thus , a major part of this work concerns the impact of implementational choices on performance , where this is defined as the ability of the system to produce pronunciations in line with those given by humans . the size and content of the lexical database on which any analogy system must be based are also considered . the better performing implementations produced useful results for both british english and german . however , best results for each of the two languages were obtained from rather different implementations . authors of abstract : authors - - - - - - - - - - - 3 ) "	0

2 ) resources must generally be installed locally to be usable ( and of course precisely how this happens , what operating systems are supported etc . varies from case to case ) . the consequences of 1 ) are that although resources share some structure in common ( lexicons are organised around words , for example ) this commonality is wasted when it comes to using a new resource ( the developer has to learn everything afresh each time ) and that work which seeks to investigate or exploit commonalities between resources ( e . g . to link several lexicons to an ontology ) has to first build a layer of access routines on top of each resources . so , for example , if we wish to do task-based evaluation of lexicons by measuring the relative performance of an information extraction system with different instantiations of lexical resource , we might end up writing code to translate several different resources into sql or sgml . the consequence of 2 ) is that there is no way to "" try before you buy "" : no way to examine a data resource for its suitability for your needs before licencing it . correspondingly there is no way for a resource provider to expose limitted access to their products for advertising purposes , or gain revenue through piecemeal supply of sections of a resource . this workshop will discuss ways to overcome these barriers . the proposers will discuss a new method for distributing and accessing language resources involving the development of a common programmatic model of the various resources types , implemented in corba idl and / or java , along with a distributed server for non-local access . this model is being designed as part of the gate project ( general architecture for text engineering : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / research / groups / nlp / gate / ) and goes under the provisional title of an active creole server . ( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algorithmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum "	0

"Subject: sum : expressions like ' put them away yet ? '  a big thank you to the persons who commented on my query ( linguist , vol . 8-808 ) on expressions like ' put them away yet ?

( 3 ) get them yet ? ( 4 ) write him yet ? ( 5 ) hear it yet ? will have a present tense reading , and that a simple past reading is not possible , has been rejected almost unanimously by my informants ( only a couple of british english speakers among them ) . for most of them the simple past interpretation is in fact dominant over the present tense interpretation ; some informants even have difficulties in imagining an appropriate situation for a present tense reading ; others , though , have reported no problems here . b ) when expressions such as ( 2 ) - ( 5 ) are used with a non-present tense meaning , there is no distinction made and perceived between meanings associated with simple past in contrast to present perfect in other constructions . ( this , then , supports bolinger saying with respect to ' put them away yet ? ' : "" i do not force you to an either-or choice between the two compatible meanings ' did you put them away yet ? ' and ' have you put them away yet ? ' , in spite of formal differences , elsewhere in the structure between _ see _ , and _ seen _ , _ do _ and _ done _ , _ go _ and _ gone _ , etc . "" . and this is what i referred to in my query as ' indeterminedness ' of meaning in contrast to ' ambiguity ' . ) c ) a number of further comments have been made , e . g . concerning the influence of context on the interpretation of these expression ; concerning the influence of the semantic class of the verbs in these expressions on their interpretation ; concerning the influence of the presence of _ yet _ . meanwhile i have found the following note in quirk et al . 's _ comprehensive grammar of the english language _ : "" in ame , the simple past is often preferred to the present perfective for the variants of the indefinite past discussed in this section [ 4 . 22 ] . compare [ _ have the children come home yet ? _ ] , for example , with _ did the children come home yet ? _ < esp ame > .

"Subject: paulston and tucker : early days of sociolinguistics  the early days of sociolinguistics : memories and reflections ( 1997 ) christina bratt paulston and g . richard tucker ( eds . ) dallas , tx : summer institute of linguistics . 162 pages , $ 37 ( paper ) . reviewed by joyce milambiling at some point in the 1960 's , along with social and political upheaval , landmark court decisions in education and a host of other social events , the discipline of sociolinguistics emerged . scholars from various other disciplines and places had of course , been doing sociolinguistic research for some time , but it was only in that decade that a group of people started systematically calling it sociolinguistics . why did this happen and who was responsible for the coming together of a talented group of people who often did not ( and to some extent still do n't ) consider themselves to be a cohesive group ? some answers to these questions can be found in this new volume edited by christina bratt paulston and g . richard tucker . the book is sub-titled "" memories and reflections , "" which describes very well the tone of the more than 30 contributions to this book . the contributions range from the editors ' introduction and epilogue , personal accounts from the practitioners and supporters of early sociolinguistic research , and short essays in memory of several important figures in the field . most of the contributions are reflections by a wide range of scholars who were instrumental in the launching of sociolinguistics . the line-up of these early participants in the enterprise of sociolinguistics is impressive ( including joshua fishman , susan ervin - tripp , wallace lambert , dell hymes , charles ferguson and others ) , and creates high expectations on the part of the reader from the outset . these expectations are , for the most part met , with the reader coming away with a real sense of the zeitgeist which allowed sociolinguistics to blossom . the book is based on the premise that if you want to find out what a certain historical period was like , you talk to the the people who were there . the editors provided the contributors with a list of 18 questions , all of which are listed in the introduction of the early days of sociolinguistics ( tedos ) . the main group of contributors , those that the book calls "" pioneers "" in sociolinguistics , come from a wide variety of disciplines and countries ( although the majority are from north america ) . the method by which the editors chose to elicit these memories has many advantages . the range of questions allows the contributors to choose which aspects of the beginning of sociolinguistics they wish ( or are able ) to talk about . most of the questions , in fact , are useful and important for the task at hand . one of these key questions was : "" please characterize for us the intellectual , social and economic ' climate ' of the time . . . "" ( pp 6 ) . this question received a great deal of attention from the contributors , and taken together their responses convince the reader that the 1960 's were an exciting time to be doing and hearing about research on language and its social context . another question asked the writers to identify "" a critical milestone - - a conference , a publication , an event . . . that marks for you the beginning of sociolinguistics "" ( page 6 ) . many of the contributors identified as milestones the conference at the university of california at los angeles ( ucla ) on sociolinguistics in 1964 which later resulted in william bright 's edited volume of the proceedings . many of them also mentioned the linguistic society of america 's ( lsa ) summer seminar that same year in bloomington , indiana . another frequently mentioned milestone was the creation of the committee on sociolinguistics of the social science research council ( ssrc ) , also in 1964 . however , an overview of the articles that were written for this book ( there were also a couple of reprinted articles ) reveals that the authors focused only on a handful of the questions that the editors said they might consider . some , such as the two mentioned above , provide fascinating information about the people and events at that time . other questions , for example the one that asked who received the first doctorate in sociolinguistics , seem to be less germane to the purpose of the book and were not answered ( at least not definitively ) by many of the contributing authors . the articles in tedos vary greatly in terms of length and personal involvement of the author with the subject . susan ervin tripp 's article ( the development of sociolinguistics ) deals mostly with the history of organizations that were crucial to the early development of sociolinguistics , in particular the sociolinguistics committee at the social science research council ( ssrc ) . basil bernstein included his remembrances of the beginnings of the discipline and his part in the difference / deficit debate , which he pointedly states "" was of little theoretical significance and , indeed , obscured more than it revealed "" ( page 47 ) . as an appendix to his article , bernstein adds a point-by - point critique of william labov 's paper , "" the logic of non - standard english . "" dell hymes credited noam chomsky with the development of the field of sociolinguistics "" because of his statement in aspects of the theory of syntax . . . which defined the goal of linguistic theory in such a way as to eliminate people and use ( page 122 ) . these contributions give the reader important insights into what the contributors were doing and thinking about over 30 years ago , as well as how they see that involvement today . not all of the contributors were positive about what was happening in sociolinguistics at the time , which adds balance and a touch of reality to the book . an interesting feature of tedos is the inclusion of some of the institutional actors in the development of sociolinguistics . without adequate funding , research and interaction among scholars and practitioners happens haphazardly or not at all , and institutions like the ford foundation , the u . s . department of education , the center for applied linguistics and the summer institute of linguistics were all key players in the early era of sociolinguistics . dick thompson of the department of education added his own voice to the group , saying that the launching of sputnik was , for him , "" the beginning of ' modern sociolinguistics ' "" in that funds for education and language study skyrocketed ( pun intended ) and thus deeply impacted educational attitudes and projects . another important feature of this volume is the effort taken by the editors to include as diverse a group as possible , especially scholars who represent third world countries . bonifacio sibayan talks about the serious problem of funding in countries like his philippines , and how collaboration with foreign institutions and researchers allowed some third world countries to better investigate language issues and problems within their own borders . e . annamalai discusses the development of sociolinguistics in india , and how linguistic research done in india ( both by indigenous and outside researchers ) has contributed to a greater understanding of sociolinguistic phenomena . the editors also do a fine job of introducing their book and providing final comment on its contents . taken together , these chapters function as conceptual bookends . bratt paulston 's introduction provides explanations for their rationale and choice of contributors , as well as what the contributors were asked to address , and tucker 's epilogue sums up the major themes that emerged . these five themes were : the interdisciplinary nature of the field and the events that launched it ; the social issues that sparked the emergence of socio - linguistics as a discipline of study ; the importance of a number of key individuals ; the difference between the north american / european perspective and that of researchers from developing countries ; and the important role of a few funding organizations in supporting sociolinguistic research and dialogue . the book is generally well edited with few errors . the bibliography is valuable in that it combines the references from all of the contributed articles into one collective group of books and articles . the one disadvantage to this is that the references have come from scholars working in different fields and thus using different bibliographic styles . a result is that some of the first names are abbreviated while others are written using the full names . this is minor if your discipline abbreviates first names , but is more of a problem if you want to cite or look up a reference and do not have the full first name . there are also a couple of typographical errors : for example , on page 302 in an article commemorating the work of heinz kloss , the term "" abstand "" is misspelled ( although it is spelled correctly elsewhere in the article ) , and on page 217 the biographical note on sibayan should read that he is on the "" komisyon sa wikang filipino . "" as a final note , the publishers of tedos say that the audience of the book should include people in the fields represented by the contributors ( such as sociolinguists , social psychologists , linguistic anthropologists and applied linguists in general ( back cover ) . they also speculate that historians of science will be interested in reading about the evolution of the discipline of sociolinguistics as an academic discipline which has grown over the decades in importance and visibility . a problem with this is that researchers and practitioners who are involved with sociolinguistic issues may not be interested in how the field came about unless this history is somehow explicitly folded into their own disciplines . i would like to see tedos on the syllabus for a history of linguistics course , for example , but am not optimistic that that it would generally be accepted as such . i do believe , however , that this is an important book for anyone interested in the people and institutions that were responsible for the existence and growth of sociolinguistics . references : bright , william , ed . 1966 . sociolinguistics : proceedings of the ucla sociolinguistics conference , 1964 . janua linguarum , series major 20 . the hague : mouton . chomsky , noam . 1965 . aspects of the theory of syntax . cambridge , ma : mit press . labov , william . 1970 . the logic of non-standard english . proceedings of the georgetown university round table on language and linguistics , 1969 . washington , d . c . : georgetown university press .

how are sign languages understood in real time ( specifically , what mechanisms are required to interpret co-reference conveyed spatially ? what are the effects of late language acquisition on language processing ? how does experience with a signed language impact non-linguistic visual-spatial cognition ( specifically , face processing , memory , and imagery ) ? what is the nature of working memory for sign language ? what is the neural organization for signed and spoken language ? specifically , what brain areas are involved in the comprehension and production of spatial language ( i . e . , describing space with classifiers or prepositions ) ? dr . emmorey 's keynote address will focus on only a small subset of these questions . she will address the consequences of using signing space to describe physical space for language and cognitive processing . dr . carol padden dr . padden received her bachelor of science degree in linguistics from georgetown university , and her ph . d . , also in linguistics , from the university of california at san diego . her current work is in the area of reading ability in signing deaf children , and areas of interest include : culture and language , representational systems in sign languages ( for example , fingerspelling ) , and reading development in young deaf children . the topic of her keynote presentation will be : reading research with signers : a new research direction . dr . lars wallin dr . wallin is a faculty member at the university of stockholm , in stockholm , sweden , in the department of sign language . he was born deaf and attended a deaf school growing up . he got his phd in sign language , 1994 , at stockholm university , writing his thesis on polysynthetic signs in swedish sign language . his phd was the first phd in sign language in the world ( others took phd in linguistics or other subjects , but not in sign language . ) he was also the first deaf person in sweden to get his phd . his current work is researching and training in sign language linguistics at stockholm university . his current research is on : the use of classifier signs as free forms in noun phrases in narrative discourse in swedish sign language ; the use of handshapes and movements as bound morphemes in signs describing shape and size of the entities in swedish sign language . pre-conference workshop thursday , november 12 , 2 : 00 - 5 : 00 p . m . we are offering a workshop for those who are not familiar with theoretical linguistic issues . we will define phonology , morphology , syntax , language acquisition , and sociolinguistics , and discuss what each discipline is all about . this will give participants an opportunity to catch up with current , hot issues that conference presenters will be discussing . we will also briefly describe the presenters works , views and arguments and compare how each presenter s works are similar or different from others . the workshop will take place before the conference begins . it is designed to help you gain confidence and be able to participate effectively during the conference . please note that if you plan to participate in the pre-conference workshop , you must pre-register for the conference by october 9 . registration deadline : october 9 , 1998 . you must pre-register for this workshop . workshop fee : $ 30 conference registration for information related to registration and accommodations . college for continuing education attn : tislr ' 98 gallaudet university kellogg conference center 800 florida avenue , ne washington , dc 20002-3695 u . s . a .

( 2 ) there will be around twenty slots for presentations of selected papers . each selected paper will be allotted 25 minutes , including discussion . there will only be plenary sessions . abstract submission to submit a paper , participants are requested to send one original and four anonymous copies of a one-page abstract , by regular mail . each abstract should at least contain the following information : names of authors , title of the paper , brief description of the content of the paper , and an indication of how this paper is related to the theme of the congress the abstract should preferably be printed in times new roman on white paper of a4 size , with top and bottom margins of 2 . 54 cm and left and right margins of 3 . 17 cm . the total number of words in the abstract should not exceed 500 . together with the abstract please send a 3 "" x 5 "" index card with the following information : - title of the paper ; - name ( s ) of author ( s ) ; - mail address of ( first ) author ; - affiliation ; - phone number ; - electronic mail address of ( first ) author . deadline the abstract must have reached us before may 15th 1998 . on the basis of abstracts , selection will take place during the month of june 1998 . notification of acceptance or rejection will be given before july 1st 1998 . practical information organizing institute : utrecht institute of linguistics ots congress committee : sieb nooteboom ( chairman ) , leslie dijkstra ( secretariate ) , jan don , ton naaijkens , henriette de swart , arie verhagen , fred weerman , frank wijnen dates : deadline abstracts : may 15th 1998 notification : before july 1st early registration : before october 1st 1998 congress : october 19th , 20th , and 21st 1998 fees : registration before october 1st 1998 : dfl 100 , - ( dfl . 50 , - for students with proof of studentship ) registration after october 1st 1998 : dfl . 150 , - ( dfl . 75 , - for students with proof of studentship ) registration a registration form is available from our secretariate ( for address see above ) or can be found at our website http : / / www-uilots . let . ruu . nl / uil - ots / conferences / sc _ home . htm * * * * * the utrecht congress on storage and computation in linguistics 1998 utrecht institute of linguistics ots trans 10 3512 jk utrecht the netherlands phone : # 31 30 253 6006 fax : # 31 30 253 6000 e-mail : uil-ots @ let . ruu . nl * * * * * "	0
"Subject: disc : grammar in uk schools  i was disturbed to find some traditional fallacies in geoffrey sampson 's discussion of the teaching of grammar in schools . though i no longer have a copy of prof . cameron 's original post , i do recall the essentials of it , and found that mr . sampson had passed over the valid point it was making in favour of a prescriptivist , "" back to basics "" defense of traditional grammatical education . prof . cameron is perfectly correct in ridiculing the inflexible , rote and prescriptive approach to grammar which is conventionally inflicted on students throughout the english speaking world . the issue of being able to use standard english ( or perhaps _ a _ standard english ) correctly is entirely separate from the reliance on traditional "" rules "" which are frequently unhelpful , and often grossly inaccurate . the rule regarding finishing sentences with prepositions , as one glaring example , is a total misunderstanding of both the history of english , and an unhelpful preoccupation for effective communication . > strikes me as akin to suggesting that teachers of > french should forget about teaching the past participle of "" vivre "" in > favour of getting their pupils to develop considered opinions about > the theories of derrida . though mr . sampson has used an interesting rhetorical image here , it is in fact a false analogy . teaching students to get a feel for the function of grammar and language is a far cry from teaching them gb theory or hpsg . an understanding of how sentences , clauses , verb tenses , adverbs , etc . actually function on a basic level is a very reasonable educational goal , and far more worthy then just creating a bunch of "" do n't "" 's and "" never "" 's and calling that grammatical education . > beyond that , though , teaching orthography and grammar at school level > has a much broader educational value . one of the lessons we all have > to learn is that nothing big and worthwhile is ever achieved in this > life without careful attention to endless tedious and often arbitrary > details . at the risk of making a gross national stereotype , i feel compelled to quote george bernard shaw : "" the british believe that they are moral when they are merely uncomfortable . "" this notion that education ( or work , for that matter ) must be unpleasant to produce results is a puritanical relic . in my personal experience , the very successful people tend to be precisely the ones who know how to delegate , slough off or avoid wasting time with "" tedious and arbitrary details "" . ( please read the preceding paragraph with the tongue planted in the general vicinity of the cheek . ) in a spirit of greater seriousness though , i would like to second prof . cameron 's call to educators to abandon prescriptive , rule-based approaches to grammar , and embrace a more general approach based on a comprehension of more fluid and meaningful principles . i believe that the result would be students with a better grasp of the form and function of language rather than a shallow and inflexible mastery of facile rules . - - - - marc hamann "	0

Subject: disc : evolution analytic > synthetic  as far as i can tell , melanie misanchuk 's query > i once read that the natural evolution of a language is from > analytic to synthetic . i ' ve been unable to find that assertion > since , and am wondering if i made it up . has been answered very inadequately . since her summary was posted on linguist , i feel that some corrections are necessary . judging from some of the replies melanie received , the view is still widespread that linguistic evolution can go in both directions , i . e . that there is no inherent directionality in language change . this is wrong . at the same time , we can't say globally that languages tend to change either from synthetic to analytic ( as some 19th century linguists thought ) or vice versa . what is going on is quite simple : we have to look at constructions , not at languages . we then see that there is a universal directionality of change : analytic constructions always turn into synthetic constructions ( unless they die out ) , and synthetic constructions are always replaced by newly created analytic constructions . ) that is , synthetic constructions never turn into analytic constructions , and analytic constructions are never replaced by newly created synthetic constructions . ( so both synthetic > analytic and analytic > synthetic are universal , but in different senses . ) when quite a few synthetic constructions are simultaneously replaced by analytic constructions , then one can get the impression that the language as a whole changes from the synthetic type to the analytic type - - this is what 19th century linguists such as august schlegel , wilhelm von humboldt , august schleicher , max mueller and others emphasized . ( the cycle mentioned by rob pensalfini was first described by georg von der gabelentz in 1891 . ) at the same time , 19th century linguists ( e . g . franz bopp and william d . whitney ) also recognized that the development from analytic to synthetic ( which they called agglutination , now called grammaticalization ) is possible and common , but they were confuded because they tended to think in terms of languages rather than constructions . it is true that 19th century linguists had some preconceptions about their own languages ( actually , latin and greek ) being the best languages , but this does not mean that all their insights are totally discredited . martin haspelmath , free university of berlin / university of bamberg 	0

incorporation . the second chapter lays the foundations of characterising syntax and logic separately . the third chapter introduces labelled deductive systems , the framework used in the remainder of the thesis . part ii is an analysis of morphological causatives , passives and reflexives in turkish . it is proposed that the causative affix in turkish has declarative content and behaves like a predicate . a unitary account is provided for passivisation and reflexivization whereby both processes are characterised in terms of logical dependency . the sixth chapter is on the combination of causatives , passives and reflexives . the final chapter discusses the status of the projection principle , theta theory , case theory , the mirror principle ) in a mono-stratal grammar . one of the main issues that is discussed is case-marking . it is proposed that case gives instructions for structure building in the combinatorial process . the proposed properties of case are tested in causative constructions and verified in passives , reflexives and their various combinations . focus and copular constructions in hausa melanie green , 1997 this thesis examines the syntax of focus constructions in hausa within a principles and parameters / minimalist framework ( chomsky 1995 ) . a unified analysis is presented to account for the properties of focus - fronting constructions in hausa , and also the properties of ( apparently unrelated ) copular constructions which are also shown to have focus properties . it is argued that the ` copula ' found in both focus - fronting and copular constructions in hausa is not a verbal or inflectional element as argued by mcconvell ( 1973 ) and tuller ( 1986a ) respectively , but instead the spellout of a functional category f ( ocus ) in the sense of brody ( 1990 ) . the thesis presents an introduction to the main syntactic characteristics of hausa , as well as a general introduction to the phenomenon of focus , including typological and comparative discussion to show the various cross-linguistic syntactic manifestations of focus . the fp analysis is also considered from a cross-linguistic perspective to see how it might account for focus and copular constructions in a range of languages related to hausa , and it is shown that although some languages present challenging cases for an fp analysis , there is considerable support for an approach of this nature . movement and optionality in syntax anna pettiward , 1997 can the operation move , construed as a copying operation ( chomsky 1993 , 1995 ) , be assumed to apply in principle to any element ( as was the operation move - alpha in the gb framework ) ? and if move is constrained by economy conditions , rather than applying or not at will , how can one characterize phenomena appearing to involve optional movement ? these are the two questions which this thesis attempts to answer ( parts i and ii respectively ) . part i proposes that all copies in a chain - as opposed to some ( cf . chomsky 1995 ) - are active in the computational system . this assumption is argued for at length on both theoretical and empirical grounds . part ii develops a multiple optimal derivations ( cf . chomsky 1991 ) theory of syntactic optionality . a detailed analysis is provided of optionality ( plus associated non-optionality ) effects from a number of languages including french ( participle agreement ) , english and swedish ( optional partial associate movement with non - case / agreement-checking expletives there and det ' it ' ) , and icelandic , german and dutch ( optional overt object shift ) . wh - movement , licensing and the locality of feature - checking andrew simpson , 1995 investigating the syntax of wh-constructions across a wide variety of languages , this thesis re-examines the assumption that feature-checking relations may only be effected within the strict locality of spec - head / head-adjoined configurations . a range of evidence from apparently optional wh-movement languages such as hindi and iraqi arabic is argued to provide a strong empirical challenge to the strict locality hypothesis and indicate instead that feature-checking relations may in fact be non - spec - head-local and effected without movement to the relevant licensing head . integrating such results with the patterning of wh-questions in english , japanese and romanian - type languages , the basic account developed is shown to allow for a model in which dynamic syntax terminates at spell - out and also permits an analysis of partial movement questions which avoids the severe problems such structures pose for standard minimalist approaches . including also a final chapter on n - word licensing and the possible parasitic relation of scrambling to feature-checking , the thesis provides a critical overview of minimalism , an introduction to the wide variety of wh-construction - types present in natural language and in depth discussion of the opacity effects created by tense for various licensing relations . a study of chinese reflexives xian fu yu , 1996 this thesis is an in-depth investigation of the distribution and interpretation of the reflexive pronouns ziji , ziji-benshen and ta-ziji and reflexive-marked verbs ( zi-verb ) in mandarin chinese . it argues that all types of reflexive pronouns can be either locally-bound or long-distance bound under certain circumstances . making reference to aspects of lexical , pragmatic and discourse structure , as well as drawing on work in traditional chinese syntax and data from historical and literary sources , the thesis provides an explanation for the local and long-distance binding effects in terms of different internal structures hypothesized for reflexive elements . local - binding is a function of being assigned an anaphoric theta role by a verb and lf adjunction to vp , whereas long-distance logophoric interpretations result when the internal structure of a reflexive incorporates a pro element . phonology conditions on nuclear expressions in phonology margaret cobb , 1997 this thesis is a principled examination of the distribution of ` tense / lax ' and ` high / low ' vowels in harmony systems . i exploit the interaction of the parameter settings of three universal mechanisms in the framework of government phonology . first i present the type of language data the thesis accounts for and evaluate other approaches in the literature to ` height ' / ' atr ' harmony . then i present the theoretical tools used in my analysis : licensing constraints ( parameters on element distribution ) , head licensing ( a condition on the distribution of headed expressions in harmony systems ) , and the complexity condition ( a condition on phonological government ) . licensing constraints and head - licensing combine to provide a four-way typology of ` atr ' - type harmony . this is illustrated with data from zulu , pulaar , turkana and akan . the basic mechanism is then also suggested to be subject to the complexity condition . i examine the harmony systems of languages which have this parameter switched ` on ' , manifesting ` height ' / ' atr ' harmony effects : natal portugese , lena bable , yoruba and ogori . finally i explore the implications the thesis has for the treatment of other harmony languages which have been discussed in the literature e . g . chukchee , chichewa , pasiego and kera . the role of the element i in khalkha mongolian phonology margaret ann denwood this thesis , which is written within the framework of government phonology , revolves around phenomena related to the element i in khalkha mongolian . the all-pervasive influence and the structural requirements of i explain the relationship between palatal and palatalised consonants and umlaut as well as vowel harmony . relationships between syllabic constituents and evidence that these do not branch lay a fopundation for the proposal that mongolian , like chinese , has a basic four position template . the number and nature of consonants involved in sequences suggest that inter-onset government takes place between onsets belonging to stem and suffix templates . the distribution and behaviour of palatal and palatalised consonants , showing that a special relationship exists between a nucleus dominating ( i ) and the preceding onset , has implications for the representation of mongolian consonants . vowel harmony is analysed as head-licensing , the revised gp analysis of atr - harmony . licensing constraints generate nuclear expressions , whilst additional constraints on a nucleus dominating a doubly-linked i element explain umlaut and related phenomena , also supporting the head-licensing analysis against an i - harmony analysis . the phonological basis of speech recognition geoffrey williams , 1998 this thesis explores an alternative approach to speech recognition based on the theory of government phonology ( gp ) . the main aim is to test a fundamental claim of the theory , that phonology is central to human speech recognition , by means of implementation and theoretical argumentation . a further claim of the thesis is that the application of gp to automatic speech recognition ( asr ) can provide insights into the nature of phonology . analysis of the central problems of speech recognition leads to the conclusion that decoding by the linear segmental model central to previous phonologically motivated work , cannot succeed since it constitutes neither an accurate nor computationally feasible model of speech processing . we propose an alternative approach based on a combination of a phonological parser and the gp elements as recognition targets . we first explore the mapping between elements and the speech signal and show that there is some support for the direct mapping hypothesis between gp elements and the signal and that they therefore can form plausible recognition targets . we then motivate the use of a gp parser in asr , claiming that constituent structure as understood in gp can be recovered fairly directly from the signal and allows for reconstruction of speech segments which are corrupted by noise or other effects . an implementation of both the parser and the element detectors , based on neural networks , is described in some detail . the final chapter proposes functional explanations for the nature of phonological licensing , and for certain distributional anomalies in a number of languages , as well as addressing the computability of phonological derivations in gp in comparison to finite-state models . we show that the limited derivational machinery of gp ensures the tractability of phonological interpretation without sacrificing explanatory power . on pitch accent phenomena in standard japanese yuko yoshida , 1995 this thesis aims to demonstrate the merits of a theoretical approach to accent assignment in standard japanese . furthermore , it attempts to show that the formal treatment of pitch accent assignment is identical to that of stress assignment in languages such as english . the proposed analysis is based on a model of government-licensing , and rejects the idea of an ' inter-syllabic foot ' construction in favour of the phonological notions of 'd omain ' and ' inter-nuclear licensing ' . another goal of this work is to expand the definition of a licensing domain - - from its minimal form , a binary licensing domain within an onset or nucleus ( rhyme ) constituent , as proposed in kaye , lowenstamm & vergnaud ( klv ) ( 1990 ) , to its maximal form , a phrase . at all levels of phonological representation ( including the skeletal level - - projection zero ) the government / licensing relation is maximally binary ( klv 1990 ) , and it is around this binarity of inter-nuclear licensing that accent assignment in standard japanese is constructed . among the issues addressed are ( i ) an explanatory account of accent assignment in so-called compounds , and ( ii ) a new approach to the assignment of pitch within sentences . these issues elucidate how high-pitch assignment reflects the syntactic structure of the compound or sentence in question . 	0

Subject: minimizing the effort for language resource acquisition  call for participation a workshop on minimizing the effort for language resource acquisition granada , spain , 26 may , 1998 in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 28-30 , may 1998 ( see http : / / ceres . ugr . es / ~ rubio / elra . html for details and how to register ) the workshop will be devoted to any technological and administrative facet of economy of acquisition effort . tentative program : ( svetlana sheremetyeva , organizer ) 0 . introduction . s . sheremetyeva full papers : 1 . reusing swedish language processing resources in svensk f . olsson , b . gamback and m . eriksson 2 . a cost - effective approach to multilingual lexicon acquisition e . viegas , s . nirenburg , b . onyshkevych and v . raskin 3 . speeding - up the building of new ontologies using bilingual dictionaries l . griot 4 . matching resource acquisition work to needs of an application s . nirenburg and r . zajac 5 . minimization strategies in neurotran n . koncar , s . pawlowski , d . sipka and v . sipka 6 . refining a bi - lingual mrd using a corpus based tool . j . cowie general discussion . workshop scope and aims - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - an applied nlp system must produce adequate results and must be made deployable within reasonable time . gathering and acquiring language resources to build an application system is very time-consuming , and it is imperative to find ways of speeding up acquisition of high quality , useful static knowledge sources such as a variety of grammars , lexicons , corpora , etc . viability of avoiding massive resource acquisition , if possible , must also be carefully considered . resource acquisition should include methods , based both on sound theoretical principles and practical experience , of deciding , among other things , on the amount of knowledge one * really * needs for a given application . increasing the size of knowledge sources or their number and variety does not necessarily lead to a commensurate improvement of output quality in an application , though a correlation between the two certainly exists , but it definitely needs to much increased costs . no matter how large the acquired resources are and how many of them have been acquired , there will always remain a residue of language processing problems which can be tackled only by foregoing the requirement of full automation and involving expensive semi-automatic or even manual acquisition . it becomes imperative , therefore , to assess when the static knowledge source acquisition is no longer profitable . thus , in a system for interactive authoring and automatic generation of patent claim texts , the lexical knowledge base can be restricted to a lexicon of domain-related verbs marked for subcategorization ( as the nominals are provided interactively by the author ) . the technological issues to be discussed at the conference include , but are not limited to : - minimization of effort in acquiring monolingual and multilingual text corpora ; - minimization of effort in acquiring computational lexicons , including phonological , morphological , syntactic , semantic and other ( including application-specific ) information ; - minimization of effort in acquisition of resources for the support of corpus-based language engineering methods ; - minimization of effort in acquiring grammatical coverage of languages and sublanguages ; - methods of determining levels of reusability of existing language resources ; - balancing the needs of the application and the grain size of language description ; - minimization of effort through balancing automatic and interactive methods of knowledge acquisition ; - evaluation of potential utility of resources to applications ; program committee : svetlana sheremetyeva , nmsu crl , usa ( chair ) eduard hovy , usc isi , usa bernardo magnini , irst , italy sergei nirenburg , nmsu crl , usa victor raskin , purdue university , usa frederique segonde , xerox research centre europe , france leo wanner , university of stuttgart , germany 	0

Subject: re : 8 . 826 , disc : evolution analytic > synthetic  just to add a little more to the value judgment part of martin haspelmath 's very clear explication of current views of the evolution of typology , i should point out that otto jespersen believed that the evolution from synthetic to analytic ( such as has happened between old and modern english ) was an overall improvement , with an assumption that totally isolating languages like chinese represented the ideal goal of languages . i do n't have my copy easily available , but i believe this view can be found in the philosophy of grammar . i have heard it suggested that the reason j believed this was he believed english was close to an ideal language . i second martin 's claim that the view that there is a fairly clear consensus among historical linguists about the directionality he discusses . current introductory texts certainly include discussion of this view - - a nice discussion can be found , for example in terry crowley 's _ an introduction to historical linguistics _ ( oxford , 1992 ) , and similar discussions can be found in other current texts . geoff geoffrey s . nathan department of linguistics southern illinois university at carbondale , carbondale , il , 62901 usa phone : + 618 453-3421 ( office ) fax + 618 453-6527 + 618 549-0106 ( home ) 	0

they also show that two-language contact situations can give rise to pidgins , especially when access to a target language is withheld by its speakers . the chapters are arranged according to language type : three focus on pidgins ( hiri motu , by tom dutton ; pidgin delaware , by ives goddard ; and ndyuka - trio pidgin , by george l . huttar and frank j . velantie ) , two on creoles ( kituba , by salikoko s . mufwene , and sango , by helma pasch ) , one on a set of pidgins and creoles ( arabic - based contact languages , by jonathan owens ) , one on the question of early pidginization and / or creolization in swahili ( by derek nurse ) , and five on bilingual mixed languages ( michif , by peter bakker and robert a . papen ; media lengua and callahuaya , both by pieter muysken ; and mednyj aleut and ma ' a , both by sarah thomason ) . the authors ' collective goal is to help offset the traditional emphasis , within contact-language studies , on pidgins and creoles that arose as an immediate result of contact with europeans , starting in the age of exploration . the accumulation of case studies on a wide diversity of languages is needed to create a body of knowledge substantial enough to support robust generalizations about the nature and development of all types of contact language . creole and dialect continua standard acquisition processes in belize and china ( prc ) genevieve escure 1997 x , 307 pp . creole language library , 18 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 173 1 price : $ 89 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 5240 8 price : hfl . 150 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com although there is a substantial amount of linguistic research on standard language acquisition , little attention has been given to the mechanisms underlying second dialect acquisition . using a combination of function-based grammar and sociolinguistic methodology to analyze topic marking strategies , the unguided acquisition of a standard by speakers of nonstandard varieties is examined in two distinct linguistic and geographical situations : in a caribbean creole situation ( belize ) , with special attention to the acquisition of acrolects by native speakers of basilects , and in a noncreole situation ( prc ) , documenting the acquisition of standard chinese ( putonghua ) by speakers of nonstandard varieties represented in cultural revolution literature , wuhan chinese , and suzhou wu story-telling style . in both cases psychosocial factors , linguistic bias toward nonnative renderings of the standard varieties , the social status of their speakers , and related political and educational consequences play an important role in the development of second dialects . the broad-ranging analysis of a single feature of oral discourse leads to the formulation of cross-linguistic generalizations in acquisition studies and results in an evaluation of the putative uniqueness of creole languages . related issues addressed include the effect of linguistic bias on the development and use of language varieties by marginalized groups ; the interaction of three major language components - semantics , syntax , and pragmatics - in spontaneous communication ; and the development of methods to identify discourse units . the ultimate goal underlying the comparison of specific discourse variables in belizean and chinese standard acquisition is to evaluate the relative merits of substratal , superstratal , and universal explanations in language development . for further information please e-mail bernadette keck : service @ benjamins . com 	0

Subject: info  dear ion , i am very happy to have found you . i had no idea so many people also = share this interest in figurative language . i find this very exciting = because it 's the language i work in . the operational language of = computers is binary . the operational language of the human mind is = pictures . i use psychotherapy called metaphor therapy that takes all = figurative statements and treats them literally . if you take an = interest in figurative speech , i thought you might like to know more = about this . it 's an approach that looks for the figures in figurative = speech and uses them to heal or dissolve persistent uncomfortable = feelings . the figures of speech that salt out language reflect the inner figures = of the subconscious mind . so , for example , if someone says there 's a = cloud over his or her head , in the subconscious mind there is a cloud . = the cloud feels real internally because the subconscious mind accepts = what it sees as real ( that 's why dreams appear real when the conscious = mind is turned off during sleep ) . = 20 this is important because it 's the key to the inner mind . treating the = figures ( pictures ) as real opens up the subconscious mind because it = accepted the images as real to begin with . these figures and images = reflect our inner world and bring fascinating information to the = surface . working within the realm of a person 's own symbolic = representation of their problem or issue facilitates profound change . = using words that go to the core of our thinking and feelings helps to = change behavior , decisions and choices . = 20 there is a strong connection between figurative language and healing . = that understanding has produced a new verbal technology for entering the = control center of the mind and healing the psyche . it uses the figures = in language to go to the root of the psyche , where thoughts , feelings = and decisions originate . affecting change from this vantagepoint = produces greater satisfaction in personal life and professional = performance . productivity is , above all , a state of mind ; so we can never = underestimate the power of the mind in affecting all realms of health = and happiness . to best gain an improved control of life , we go to the = control center where thoughts and feelings begin . thoughts and feelings = come to conscious awareness without any effort on our part and they come = directly from the conscious mind . the language of the subconscious is = neither english nor japanese , but pictures and images . metaphor therapy is a unique , innovate approach that speaks the same = operational language as the inner mind . the subconscious mind is not = only the very foundation of our ego , thinking and emotions ; it is also = where most depression , anxiety , eating and compulsive disorders , = phobias , obsessive thoughts , urges and unwanted behavior originate . = while this was already known , what 's new is the understanding that = behind each of these symptoms are persistent uncomfortable feelings . what is also new is the ability to speak a therapeutic picture-language = that goes to the inner mind where obstacles begin , and use these = uncomfortable feelings as a trail that leads to the root of almost any = problem . change occurring at the root is always more dynamic than = change at the surface and leads to outward changes , as well . inner = healing promotes outward change , more control and a stronger mind . going directly into the control center of the mind has an added benefit = of recapturing the wholeness and innate strength we were born with . it = is natural that in the course of growing up we lose parts of self as we = adjust to the demands of the world . as children , we may be subject to = abuse , neglect or trauma . our spirit may be broken or bruised along the = way , but we conform and put our feelings aside . as adults , if we ' re = caught in a life threatening situation where death appears imminent , it = takes even more out of us if the ego dissociates just prior to the = event . shutting down as a way of avoiding the event or the feelings = that go with it , the ego goes somewhere else as a way of not letting it = happen . when qualities and characteristics of self are lost , it leaves = a vague , lingering feeling that something is missing . recovering the missing fragments of self and restoring them is not = esoteric nonsense . it is a concrete discipline based on recent = advancements that permit direct access to our inner mind . speaking the = language of the inner mind affords the best opportunity for healing to = occur . restoration of self dissolves a great many negative feelings , and = makes the mind clearer and the will stronger . metaphor therapy = unleashes the strong , innate power within by using the mind 's ability to heal itself , and creates a base of = self-confidence that is genuine and lasting . = 20 i want to get the word out about metaphor therapy . since this may be = some real hope for some people , please share this letter with others . = as for my part , i would be happy to give you any specific information = about the approach or answer any questions you may have . also , if you 'd = like some examples of healings that were accomplished with the use of = figurative language , please let me know . my best , = 20 = 20 drs www . angelfire . com / ak / drsiegel 	1

Subject: facial information processing  call for papers pragmatics & cognition announces a special issue on facial information processing : a multidisciplinary perspective guest editors itiel e . dror and sarah v . stevenage in many senses , faces are at the center of human interaction . at a very basic level , faces indicate identity . however , faces are remarkably rich information carriers . for example , facial gestures may be used as means of conveying intentions . faces may also permit a direct glimpse into the person 's inner self ( by unintentionally revealing , for example , aspects of character or mood ) . given their salient role , the processing of the information conveyed by faces and its integration with other sources of interactional information raise important issues in cognition and pragmatics . research on facial information processing has investigated these ( and other ) issues utilizing a variety of approaches and methodologies , and developments in both computer and cognitive sciences have recently carried this research forward . the emerging picture is that there are cognitive subsystems which specialize in different aspects of facial processing . this has been supported by neuropsychological evidence suggesting that brain damaged patients show dissociations between the different aspects of face processing . in addition , research on the development of facial processing abilities , and on aspects of the face itself which affect these processing abilities , has contributed to our understanding of how facial information is perceived . this special issue of pragmatics and cognition is intended to provide a common forum for a variety of the topics currently under investigation . given the breadth of issues and approaches used to investigate faces , we encourage submissions from a wide range of disciplines . our aim is that this special issue will tie together the diverse research on faces , and show their links and interdependencies . deadline for submission : august 1 , 1998 editorial decisions : november 1 , 1998 revised papers due : february 1 , 1999 expected publication : october 1999 papers should be submitted according to the guidelines of the journal ( see www url : http : / / www . cogsci . soton . ac . uk / ~ dror / guideline . html ) . all submissions will be peer reviewed . please send five copies of your submission either to : dr . itiel dror ( dror @ coglab . psy . soton . ac . uk ) or : dr . sarah stevenage ( svs1 @ soton . ac . uk ) dept . of psychology southampton university highfield , southampton so17 1bj england for additional and updated information see www url : http : / / www . cogsci . soton . ac . uk / ~ dror / faces . html or contact either of the guest editors . 	0

Subject: wac4  world archaeology congress 4 cape town : 10 - 14 january 1999 theme : global archaeology at the turn of the millennium wac , the world archaeology congress , was inaugurated at its first congress in southampton in 1986 , and last met in new delhi in 1994 . its conferences and inter-congresses have continued to develop the global dimension of archaeology and the social role that archaeologists play as interpreters of the past . we expect more than a thousand delegates in cape town , and we are planning an exciting and stimulating programme that will do justice to the turn of the millennium . it is appropriate that wac4 should be held in south africa . the world archaeology congress was formed in opposition to apartheid , highlighting the relationship between the study of the past and the politics of the present . south africa 's first democratic elections in 1994 ended a long , bitter era and archaeologists here are now free to be part of a world community of scholarship . the academic programme of the congress will be organised around symposia . these will be half-day , full-day or running themes , each organised by a symposium convenor . papers will be available electronically to registered delegates prior to the congress , and full details of the programme will be posted on our website as they become available . the congress will be structured around three broad themes : time ; archaeology in a global context , and the future . this will provide a rich vein of intellectual stimulation , offering a truly global perspective on a discipline that has stimulated and satisfied many for well over a century . if you would like to attend the congress , please visit our website ( url below ) and register electronically , or complete the registration form in the second announcement which will be mailed shortly . should you wish to deliver a paper , organise a symposium or workshop , present a poster or screen a film on an archaeological topic , demonstrate an archaeology-related computer program or multimedia product , or rent exhibition space at the congress , please contact the congress secretariat : contact : carolyn ackermann wac4 congress secretariat address : po box 44503 claremont 7735 south africa telephone : + 27 ( 21 ) 762 8600 fax : + 27 ( 21 ) 762 8606 e-mail : wac4 @ globalconf . co . za website : http : / / www . uct . ac . za / depts / age / wac important dates : 30 april 1998 : closing date for submission of abstracts and symposium convenor 's packages with deposits where appropriate . 31 july 1998 : preliminary programme to be mailed . applicants to be notified of acceptance of abstracts / symposia . 15 november 1998 : papers to be made available on the congress website . 	0
"Subject: judicial judgments - child support - investigator - ( 11116 )  thank you for your interest in our training course ! ! success courses offers an extensive audio training course in "" how to collect judicial judgments "" . if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a judicial judgment is and why processing judicial judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a judicial judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact : "" its now up to you to collect on the judgment "" . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . "" in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . "" the non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected judicial judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 4 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing judicial judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of judicial judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operate out of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today success courses and our associates have over 632 million dollars in judicial judgments that we are currently processing . of this 632 million , 36 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid judicial judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non-confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor does n't know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful judicial processing are as follows : = b7 mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with judicial judgments . ( we train you how to find out who to write to ) = b7 8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you do n't call them unless you want to . = b7 you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and 50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 . = b7 you then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $ 25 . 00 . = b7 once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course ) = b7 when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to the original judgment holder . = b7 once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . ( included in the course ) quote 's from several of our students : thomas in area code 516 writes us : "" i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and the video opened doors for me in the future . there 's no stopping me now . recently thomas states he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on . after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code 314 stated to us : "" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now .

Subject: the informational complexity of learning  kluwer academic publishers is proud to announce the publication of : the informational complexity of learning : perspectives on neural networks and generative grammar by partha niyogi massachusetts institute of technology among other topics , the informational complexity of learning : perspectives on neural networks and generative grammar brings together two important but very different learning problems within the same analytical framework . the first concerns the problem of learning functional mappings using neural networks , followed by learning natural language grammars in the principles and parameters tradition of chomsky . these two learning problems are seemingly very different . neural networks are real-valued , infinite-dimensional , continuous mappings . on the other hand , grammars are boolean-valued , finite-dimensional , discrete ( symbolic ) mappings . the book 's objective is to bridge this gap . it uses the formal techniques developed in statistical learning theory and theoretical computer science over the last decade to analyze both kinds of learning problems . specific results include model selection in neural networks , active learning , language learning and evolutionary models of language change . the informational complexity of learning : perspectives on neural networks and generative grammar is a very interdisciplinary work . all individuals interested in the interaction of computer science and cognitive science should enjoy the book . researchers in artificial intelligence , neural networks , linguistics , theoretical computer science , and statistics will find it particularly relevant . contents foreword . preface . 1 . introduction . 2 . generalization error for neural nets . 3 . active learning . 4 . language learning . 5 . language change . 6 . conclusions . 1998 248 pp . isbn 0-7923 - 8081 - 9 $ 98 . 00 for more information about this publication , please visit our on - line catalogue at : http : / / www . wkap . nl or you may order directly from : kluwer academic publishers 101 philip drive norwell , ma . 02061 phone : 781-871 - 6600 , fax : ( 781 ) 871-6528 , e - mail : kluwer @ wkap . com kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 322 3300 ah dordrecht , the netherlands phone 31 78 639 2392 , fax : 31 78 6546474 , e - mail : services @ wkap . nl 	0

"Subject: sum : references on ' as if / though . . . '  a few weeks ago i sent out a query to ask for references about a possible difference between ' as if ' and ' as though ' constructions in english instantiated by the following . ( 1 ) tony writes as { if / though } he { were / was / is } left-handed . ( 2 ) she looked as { if / though } she { were / was } ill . i ' ve received four replies . here i would like to thank those who took time to give me information , as listed in the following . izzy ( israel ) cohen ( req-telaviv ) < izzy @ telaviv . ndsoft . com > mark campana < campana @ hawaii . edu > david houghton < dh2 @ acsu . buffalo . edu > alessandra bertocchi < bertocchi @ ecn01 . economia . unibo . it > here is a summary . izzy cohen gave a relevant part from the random house dict . the random house online dictionary 1992 contains : though idiom 4 . < as though > as if : it seemed as though the place was deserted . ironically , the same source also contains : as 9 . though : strange as it seems , it is so . so , not only does as if = as though , sometimes as = though . re : were vs . was ( vs . is ) : this is a question of whether the subjunctive should be used . the same source advises : subjunctive ( suhb jungk ' tiv ) adj . 1 . of or designating a grammatical mood typically used for subjective , doubtful , hypothetical , or grammatically subordinate statements or questions , as the mood of be in if this be treason . compare imperative ( def . 3 indicative ( def . 2 ) . n . 2 . the subjunctive mood . 3 . a verb form in the subjunctive mood . [ 1520-30 ; < ll subjunctivus = l subjunct ( us ) , ptp . of subjungere to harness , subjoin ( sub - sub - + jungere to join ) + - ivus - ive ] derived words - - sub-junc ' tive-ly , adv . usage . the subjunctive mood has largely disappeared in english . it survives , though inconsistently , in sentences with conditional clauses contrary to fact and in subordinate clauses after verbs like wish : if the house were nearer to the road , we would hear more traffic noise . i wish i were in florida . the subjunctive also occurs in subordinate that clauses after a main clause expressing recommendation , resolution , demand , etc . : we ask that each tenant take ( not takes ) responsibility for keeping the front door locked . it is important that only fresh spinach be ( not is ) used . the subjunctive occurs too in some established or idiomatic expressions : so be it . heaven help us . god rest ye merry , gentlemen . mark campana gave his intuition : i do n't have any references on your question per se , but my intuitions tell me that ' as though ' can imply a feeling of suspicion - i . e . that [ the subject ] is trying to be something that s / he is not . this intuition is not as strong in the corresponding ' as if ' construction . david houghton gave his intuition as well : i do n't know of any papers you might read concerning this topic , but , for what it 's worth , i can offer my intuitions as a native speaker . it struck me as i contemplated the contrast that the sentences with ' as if ' were better with some past tense form , and best with the subjunctive form . those with ' as though ' were better with the indicative forms . i cannot say that my semantic intuitions on this topic are very firm , but it seems to me that there is a corresponding contrast between counterfactuality with ' as if ' and mere hypotheticalness with ' as though ' . if any or all of these distinctions are real , i suspect they are not very strictly observed in colloquial usage . alessandra bertocchi made a little research and wrote : i ' ve made a little research myself to see the difference ( if any ) between ' as if , as though ' my point of departure is latin ' quasi ' , which is ( apparent - ly ) indifferently translated with both . ' quasi ' refers to an unreal world in any case ( for the speaker ) , which can be real for the subject , in some cases . so i wonder whether this may be the difference also between ' as if / as though ' . i have found only few word on this matter in j . haimann ( 1974 ) , ' foundations of language ' 11 , p . 353 : "" in at least one construction , there is no difference , even aspectual , between the conjunctions ' if ' and ' though ' : max spends money as ( if , though ) it was going out of style i have also asked some native speakers , but no one perceives any difference . the only one who feels that it is possible that they differ ( but he is not sure of it ) is i . sag . he wrote to me that ' as though ' seems to be more counterfactual than ' as if ' . so horn suspension would give : he speaks as if he were in charge , and in fact he is ? he speaks as though he were in charge , and in fact he is but , to say it with haimann , complete mystery surrounds the nature of this construction . so , if you get more certain judgements and if there are references , please , let me know . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - thanks again for the contributions and i ' ll let you know of further progress . ken sugayama kensei sugayama dept of english kobe city univ . of foreign studies department of linguistics university of manchester e-mail : xj9k-sgym @ j . asahi-net . or . jp e-mail : k . sugayama @ stud . man . ac . uk "	0

"" cf . we have no time or money to investigate the "" so-called "" causes of crime , because there 's so much of it that we can hardly keep up with the demand for more prisons - - that 's the top priority - no time for anything else , thanks anyway . nevertheless , in principle i was not put off , and read on to find out why the top priorities are what they are . i was not disappointed , though the rationale offered seemed predictable to me , and also arguable . > people need to learn to write their national language accurately > because much of modern life depends on complex written communication , > and prose that is full of unsystematic deviations from the conventions > interferes with successful communication , as dirty windows interfere > with successful vision - - the message gets lost amid problems with the > medium . people need a terminology for talking about the bits and > pieces of language , as a car mechanic needs to know the names of the > parts of a motor , in order to provide an apparatus for thinking out > what has gone wrong and how to cure it when prose does n't "" work "" . this all sounds reasonable . and i am indeed in favor of students knowing these things . in fact , prescriptive grammatical terminology and analysis do set a foundation even for what linguists do when they "" engage in explicit , systematic reflection on what it is that we are doing when we use language "" namely , linguists start with the traditional categories , explore their motivations and then discuss where they seem to be inadequate and what would be more adequate , in view of whatever larger linguistic facts are brought to bear on whatever problem of traditional grammar . . . i realise , of course , that geoff is not arguing for this - - and so i wonder if traditional grammatical analysis etc . is either necessary or sufficient for effective "" complex communication "" . probably nobody would defend the "" sufficient "" condition in view of much obscure , if not incomprehensible , ( though "" grammatically "" flawless ) standard writing , but i also wonder about the necessary "" condition "" . that is , do you have to be able to analyse to imitate the standard way of writing ? is the standard that different from a "" natural "" language ( first learned type ) ? ( at least with some good , also professional , creative writers i know , they are not actually aware of some of the key elements of their style , e . g . , one who is very effective in using and even coining nominal compounds , but did not show recognition of this as a characteristic of his style when i mentioned it to him . ) thus , i am not challenging the notion of a standard or necesarily the demand for its use in certain contexts , but how it is presented , esp . is it this great logical thing it 's generally portrayed as , that 's gonna solve all those "" communication "" problems that have alarmed english publishers since the time of caxton ? but even more , does it have to be * explicitly * taught ? ( maybe a lot of teachers screw up teaching "" grammar "" , because that 's where a lot of students complain they get irremediably bored and just want to get the hell out of the classroom . who knows , even linguistics might be more popular , if many students had n't earlier been turned off to "" grammar "" . ) > beyond that , though , teaching orthography and grammar at school level > has a much broader educational value . one of the lessons we all have > to learn is that nothing big and worthwhile is ever achieved in this > life without careful attention to endless tedious and often arbitrary > details . i can't see a better domain for learning this lesson than > the orthography and grammar of one 's national language : it contains > the tedious details , but it relates to material which surrounds the > child in his everyday life . this is the discipline and "" moral fibre "" argument , which is the last ditch attempt at enforcing authoritarianism . as a friend of mine , an english teacher observed , his supervisor is an ambitious man , and a stickler for discipline . night school students should not wear hats in class , says the supervisor . so my friend the teacher told one recalcitrant student that once ( these are night school adults ) . the student took it off and put it right back on . my friend said . that 's it . i ' m here to teach english . he 's not bothering anybody else . i ' m not going to get sucked into some authority game . but school for children is full of such petty discipline things that are insisted upon along with learning "" subjects "" . obediance is more important than understanding . the argument is that the discipline that comes from obedience will lead to understanding in time , if there is any argument at all , cf . learning declensions and conjugations before approaching texts . ( and often the teachers do n't even know why something is insisted on . they just know that they have to be obeyed , or else the authoritarian structure collapses , and their supervisors will come down on them . ) this is what lots of kids resent about school . probably not the same ones who actually like to cause disturbances ( or can't control themselves somehow ) . is anyone unfamiliar from their childhood with what i ' m referring to ? so what basically is this "" discipline "" argument . it seems to me the argument is : the student who has mastered standard english has demonstrated ability ( not necessarily inclination ) to follow relatively complex orders and routines , and therefore can be considered capable for positions in hierarchies where following fairly complex orders is considered necessary ( or at least desirable ) . little wonder some actually call this behavioral skill "" morality "" . but can i question geoff 's rationale without questioning his view of "" ( british ) civilization "" ( that 's a quote from his message ) ? i do n't know . - - benji "	0

"Subject: sum : reactions to synthetic speech  a number of weeks ago i asked very informally for people 's reactions to synthetic speech ( also prerecorded speech ) and for studies on emotional reactions to synthetic speech . i wish to thank those who responded : osamu fujimura margaret jackman randall a . major corey miller johanna rubba stephen p . spackman i had hoped for more responses , but i have started to collect information from friends and colleagues as well . i ' ve realized that i need a more structured way of gathering info - with the possiblitiy that this ( up until now ) rather informal approach to the matter may suddenly turn into a more formal study . the respondents react both positively and negatively to synthetic speech ; one may be irritated at the "" bluntness "" of the machine , the lack of flexibility in the programs , etc . but still find the synthetic vocal information handy . > from per egil heggtveit at telenor , norway , i have received a list of references on synthetic speech , but none of the stuides cover emotional reactions . osamu fujimura wrote : > i suggest that you ask the question to marian macchi . i did . she responded the following : > two of the us telephone companies have > introduced a service called "" reverse directory assistance "" , which > is available to telephone customers . this is a telephone service whereby > a customer calls a special number , enters a telephone number using > the touchtone pad , and hears the name and address of the person to > whom that telephone number is listed . a speech synthesizer ( orator , > a text-to - speech synthesizer that we have developed here at bellcore ) > is used to speak the name and address . > before the introduction of this automated service , one of the > telephone companies offered the service with real human operators . > today the complaint rate from customers is no higher than it was > when the service was offered with real operators . > > this is not to say that use of synthetic speech is always acceptable . > in fact , many applications for synthetic speech are not adopted > becasue the speech sounds too robotic . margaret jackman wrote : > my experience with synthetic vocies is with our telephone information > system . it asks what is the name and address of the person for whom > we want the phone number . i am always annoyed since i know i will > usually have to repeat it to a real person later . > > i am also annoyed with voice mail systems that go on forever - giving > me 10 different options , instead of the voice operator who puts me > through to the person i want . > > i suppose the problem is n't the synthetic language - it is generally > very clear and concise . the problem is that when i get one it > generally wastes my time , and for that reason , i have a negative > reaction to them . . randall a . major wrote : > i ' m not sure if they ' ve worked on reactions or not , but you should try > contacting barbara grosz at > grosz @ eecs . harvard . edu > they ' ve done a lot of work on synthetic speech and she may be able to > help you . good luck !

"Subject: re : 8 . 836 , disc : punctuation  there have been several postings recently decrying the use of apostrophe-s to make an english plural form , e . g . "" dyslexic 's "" , "" sonata 's "" . on what grounds is this held to be bad english ? like everyone else , i learnt at school that the apostrophe was not to be used in english plurals except for a few exceptional cases like numerals and letters ( "" the 1990 's "" , "" three a 's "" ) . this last usage seems to have gone out of fashion recently , but apostrophes are in practice widely used in all sorts of plural forms , and they seem to have a long history of use at least in foreign or unusual words - i ' ve noticed apostrophised plurals in facsimiles of several seventeenth century books recently . exactly what are the grounds for condemning this usage ? john phillips "	0
"Subject: ws - - discourse relations - - coling / acl , august , montreal  call for papers coling / acl 98 workshop discourse relations and discourse markers august 15 , 1998 universite de montreal montreal / canada the notion of discourse relation has received many interpretations , some of which are hardly compatible with one another . nonetheless , there is a consensus among researchers that intersegment relations hold between adjacent portions of a text and that these relations may be signalled by linguistic means , including so-called cue phrases , aspect and mood shifts , theme inversions , and other markers . the workshop intends to bring together researchers working on discourse relations and discourse markers in different linguistic traditions and different nlp applications . the particular focus of the workshop is the issue of discourse relations from the viewpoint of linguistic realization . specifically , contributions should address one or more of the following questions : * what are sound methodologies for comparing similar discourse markers ( contrastive studies , distribution analyses , etc . ) ? * what are sound methodologies for relating discourse relations with potential realizations ? * are there discourse relations that are * always * lexically signalled ? are there any that are * never * lexically signalled ? * what non-lexical ( i . e . , syntactic or prosodic ) means are used to signal a relation ? * in production , how does one decide whether to signal a relation at all ? * in production , how does one motivate a choice among candidate signals for a given relation ? * in production , how does the choice of signal interact with other decisions ( in particular , those of linearizing some tree or graph structure ) ? * in analysis , is it possible to reliably infer discourse relations from surface cues ? * in analysis , how can one disambiguate polysemous signals such as "" and "" , "" since "" ( temporal or causal ) etc . ? * what are useful lexical representations of discourse markers , for both analysis and production ? * what are useful representations of discourse relations ( and the entities they relate ) , such that they facilitate the realization decision ? what features would one like to have handy in a representation so that choices can be made easily ? * are there significant differences between realizations in spoken and written language ? * how do individual languages differ in terms of any of the above issues ? organizing committee the workshop is organized by manfred stede ( technical university , berlin ) leo wanner ( university of stuttgart ) eduard hovy ( isi / usc , marina del rey ) this call for papers as well as future information on the workshop can be found at http : / / www . cs . tu-berlin . de / ~ marker / aclcolingws . html requirements for submission papers are invited that address any of the topics listed above . maximum length is 8 pages including figures and references . please use a4 or us letter format and set margins so that the text lies within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inches ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . use classical fonts such as times roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 points for text , 14 to 16 points for headings and title . latex users are encouraged to use the style file provided by acl : http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / colaclsub . sty . papers can be submitted either electronically in postscript format , or as hardcopies . submission from north america should be sent to : eduard hovy information sciences institute 4676 admiralty way marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 u . s . a . hovy @ isi . edu submissions from elsewhere should be sent to either of the following : manfred stede leo wanner tu berlin computer science department kit project group intelligent systems sekr . fr 6-10 university of stuttgart franklinstr . 28 / 29 breitwiesenstr . 20-22 d-10587 berlin d-70565 stuttgart germany germany stede @ cs . tu-berlin . de wannerlo @ informatik . uni-stuttgart . de timetable deadline for electronic submissions : april 7 , 1998 deadline for hardcopy submissions : april 10 ( arrival date ) notification of acceptance : may 1 , 1998 final manuscripts due : june 12 , 1998 program committee o sandra carberry ( u delaware ) o barbara dieugenio ( u pittsburgh ) o eduard hovy ( usc / isi ) o alistair knott ( u edinburgh ) o alex lascarides ( u edinburgh ) o owen rambow ( cogentex inc . ) o ted sanders ( u utrecht ) o donia scott ( u brighton ) o wilbert spooren ( u tilburg ) o manfred stede ( tu berlin ) o keith vander linden ( calvin college ) o marilyn walker ( att laboratories ) o leo wanner ( u stuttgart ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - eduard hovy email : hovy @ isi . edu usc information sciences institute tel : 310-822 - 1511 ext 731 4676 admiralty way fax : 310-823 - 6714 marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 project homepage : http : / / www . isi . edu / natural-language / nlp-at - isi . html "	0

"Subject: re : your requested info  thank you for your interest in our training course . success courses offers an extensive video tape training course in "" how to collect judicial judgments "" . if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a judicial judgment is and why processing judicial judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a judicial judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact : "" its now up to you to collect on the judgment "" . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . "" in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . "" the non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected judicial judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 4 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed in this profession . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing judicial judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of judicial judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operate out of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today success courses and our associates have over 632 million dollars in judicial judgments that we are currently processing . of this 632 million , 36 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid judicial judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non-confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor does n't know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful judicial processing are as follows : mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with judicial judgments . ( we train you how to find out who to write to ) 8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you do n't call them unless you want to . you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and 50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 . you then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $ 25 . 00 . once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course ) when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to the original judgment holder . once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . ( included in the course ) quote 's from several of our students : thomas in area code 516 writes us : "" i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and the video opened doors for me in the future . there 's no stopping me now . as of february 3rd , 1995 , thomas states he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on . after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code 314 stated to us : "" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now . "" after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated "" i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately $ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i will have to hire someone to help out "" marshal in area code 407 states to us "" i feel bad , you only charged me $ 189 . 00 for this course and it is a gold mine . i have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months "" > from the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following : with our course you can own your own successful business . a business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to retire on and travel the world . a business which is extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every day is new and exciting . none of your days will be hum drum . your brain is challenged . a business which protects you from corporate downsizing . a business which you can start part time from your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full time . a business which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do . a business which lets you control your own destiny . our training has made this happen for many others already . make it happen for you ! if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being , no cost or obligation on your part . please call us at 1-500 - 488-2035 . we have customer support staff available to you from 7 : 00am to 7 : 00pm ( pacific time ) monday through saturday . closed sunday . if you call this number you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel . they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation . sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations of courses . when you call our customer support line they can let you know of any specials we may be running . if you like what you read and hear about our courses , then the customer support person can work with you to place your order . we are very low key . we merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to work with us or not . thank you for your time and interest . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + another internet ad campaign produced and distributed by : cyber advertising systems , ny , ny 10011 . please call cyber advertising systems at 1-800 - 409-8302 extension 1284 if you would like us to design and distribute powerful advertising for your company . success courses is pleased with the advertising we have developed for them . if you have a solid well proven product or service then we would be proud to help your company also . if you would like to be removed from cyber advertising systems mailing list then please send an email to : lernerww223 @ yahoo . com and type remove in the subject line . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + % + "	1

"Subject: new books in theoretical & descriptive linguistics  dialogue and critical discourse : language , culture , critical theory michael macovski , fordham university this interdisciplinary volume of collected , mostly unpublished essays demonstrates how mikhail bakhtin 's theory of dialogic meaning - - and its subsequent elaborations - - have influenced a wide range of critical discourses . with essays by michael holquist , jerome j . mcgann , john searle , deborah tannen , gary saul morson , caryl emerson , shirley brice heath , don h . bialostosky , paul friedrich , timothy austin , john farrell , rachel may , and michael macovski , the collection explores dialogue not only as an exchange among intratextual voices , but as an extratextual interplay of historical influences , oral forms , and cultural heuristics as well . such approaches extend the implications of dialogue beyond the boundaries of literary theory , to anthropology , philosophy , linguistics , and cultural studies . the essays address such issues as the establishment and exercise of political power , the relation between conversational and literary discourse , the historical development of the essay , and the idea of literature as social action . taken together , the essays argue for a redefinition of literary meaning - - one that is communal , interactive , and vocatively created . they demonstrate that literary meaning is not rendered by a single narrator , nor even by a solitary author - - but is incrementally exchanged and constructed . august 1997 288 pp . ;

- - - - - - - - - constraint - based theories of phonology have become enormously popular in recent years . such theories express generalizations by stating how and when a language 's phonological forms are constrained , rather than relying on rules that actively modify the forms . computational ideas have often provided an impetus for these innovations . koskenniemi 's ( 1983 ) 2 - level morphophonological processor introduced parallel constraining relations as an alternative to an ordered system of rewrite rules . declarative phonology ( c 1990 ) focusses on the unity of representations and rules as constraints , drawing on various computational ideas from unification to temporal logic to finite-state calculi . one current constraint-based theory is optimality theory ( ot ) ( prince&smolensky 1993 ) . this theory found , at least partial , inspiration in computational work by smolensky on the relation between symbolic and subsymbolic computation . although this link with connectionism has been left largely unexplored , ot has proved to be a computationally productive theory , giving rise to several theoretical papers on computational issues related to complexity and learnability , as well as inspiring a number of implementations . this workshop is designed to foster the link between computational work and constraint-based phonology in general . to this end , it invites submissions on topics related to the computation of any constraint-based phonological formalism , including but not limited to the three mentioned above . here are some example topics : * the computational interpretation of phonological theories , * constraint ranking and interaction , eg . as in ot , * implementations of particular analyses , * results in the complexity of constraint application , * algorithms for learning constraints or constraint ranking , * results on the learnability of such constraints , * novel formalisms for constraint-based phonology , * representational issues raised by constraint-based approaches . in short , papers are invited which address computational issues in constraint-based theories of phonology . submission -

- get those teeth capped ! ! - even retire ! this is your chance , so please do n't pass it up ! please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity ! ! ! my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that costs me pennies to produce and email . i should also point out again that this mlm program is legal and every person who participates will make money . you are offering a legitimate valuable and useful product to your customers . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it 's simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four 4 financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in many other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail or email this program . by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! ( apart from time on air ) report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . the best method of sending the purchased reports back to your customers is by email ! ! all purchasers should be certain to include their email addresses to receive their reports ! ! best wishes with the program and good luck ! remember : approx . 200 , 000 new people get online weekly ! you will never ever run out of potential customers ! order your reports now ! ! ! you will not believe the income potential ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a personal note from the originator of this program . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for many years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession has now replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what has happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there have been more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the age of computerization has added to jobs disappearing also . the middle class is vanishing . those who know what they are doing invest wisely and move up . those who do not , including those who have never had anything to save or invest , are moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation and deflation and taxation will also see to that . you have just received information that can give you some financial freedom , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort .

! ! ! follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of this exciting program that you are reading now to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 500 , 000 or 2 million , or more . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! remember , the more you send out , the more potential customers you will reach . it is a pure numbers business ! ! so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials , and opportunity to become financially better off . it is up to you now - think about it - your total risk is only $ 20 ? ? ? ? !

i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i "" knew "" it would n't work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old "" i told you so "" on her when the thing did n't work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within 14 days she had received over 50 responses for report # 1 . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was stunned . i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n't work . . . i am a believer now . i have joined doris in her "" little "" hobby . i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the "" rat race "" and it 's not for me . . . we owe it all to this simple but incredible mlm program . frank t . , bel - air , md i just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it really works ! ! ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc this is the only realistic money-making offer i ' ve ever received . i participated because this plan truly makes sense . i was surprised when the $ 5 bills started filling my mail box . by the time it tapered off i had received over 8 , 000 orders with over $ 40 , 000 in cash . dozens of people have sent warm personal notes too , sharing the news of their good fortunes ! it 's been wonderful . carl winslow tulsa , ok the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . initially i let no one in the organization know that i was an attorney and , to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown this plan works like gang-busters ! ! ! so far i have had 9 , 735 total orders . . . over $ 48 , 000 ! ! ! i hope i have sparked your own excitement , if you follow the program exactly , you could have the same success i have , if not better . your success is right around the corner , but you must do a little work . good luck ! g . bank not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n't get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy i was surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders . after that it got so over-loaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i ' ll make more money this year than any years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n't matter where in the u . s . or the world for that matter , the people live . there simply is n't a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n't delete this one ! . . . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try ! ! d . wilburn , muncie , in this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and quite soon we will buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it ! ! for your sake , and for your family 's sake do n't pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending ! charles fairchild , spokane , wa $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ tips for success $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ send for your four 4 reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ while you wait for the reports to arrive : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 . name your new business . you can call it anything you wish . 2 . get a post office box ( preferred ) . 3 . edit the names and addresses on the program . you must remember , your name and address go next to report # 1 and the others all move down one , with the fourth one being bumped off the list . 4 . obtain as many email addresses as possible to send until you receive the information on mailing list companies in report # 3 . 5 . decide on the number of programs you intend to send out . the more you send , and the quicker you send them , the more money you will make . i suggest at least 100 , 000 plus by bulk email initially , and then more if you need to . if you want to make this a really big business , then send out 500 , 000 or more . the more you send the more you will make ! ! ! don ' t forget - fresh targeted lists ! ! 6 . after mailing the programs , get ready to fill the orders . the check point which guarantees your success is simply this : you must receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 . this is a must ! ! ! if you do n't within two weeks , email out more programs until you do . then a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 , this is a must also ! ! ! if you do n't , send out more programs until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , ( take a deep breath ) you can sit back and relax . . . . . . . if you want to , because you should make at least $ 50 , 000 cash . mathematically it is a proven guarantee . of those who have participated in the program and reached the above guarantees - all have reached their $ 50 , 000 goal . also , remember , every time your name is moved down the list you are in front of a different report , so you can keep track of your program by knowing what people are ordering from you . it ' s that easy , really , it is !

"Subject: re : 8 . 792 , disc : grammar in uk schools - - a response  having been engaged in the same sort of debate for several decades on this side of the atlantic , i tend to agree with professor sampson 's remarks on the value of teaching grammar in the uk schools . but because we do not all agree on _ what _ "" grammar "" should be taught , and because the public , even the educated public , even school teachers and administrators , are , at least in the u . s . , ignorant of the last century 's work in linguistics , teaching grammar does not turn out to be as easy as professor sampson seems to imply it is . for example , for many , probably most , linguists "" correct usage "" is not part of grammar . as a sociolinguist , i would prefer that correct usage be taught in secondary schools - - but clearly labeled as something other than grammar . and even within what nearly all of us would consider "" grammar , "" what should be taught . most educators ( sic ) in the u . s . and most politician would seem to prefer traditional grammar , which we linguists have misnamed "" prescriptive grammar "" ( when it is actually mostly proscriptive ) . to me , teaching traditional grammar has all the attraction of teaching phlogiston theory to non-scientists and passing it off as serious science . many of my colleagues in linguistics disagree . so the question is not "" should grammar be taught in uk schools ?

"Subject: new books in general linguistics  different games , different rules : why americans and japanese misunderstand each other haru yamada , university of westminster , uk with a foreword by deborah tannen japan and the united states are in closer contact politically and economically than ever before , yet in many ways our nations are as far from mutual understanding as ever . misconceptions and miscommunications between east and west continue to plague this important relationship , frustrating the best efforts of both cultures to work together . stereotypes abound : americans see japanese as evasive and inscrutable , while japanese see americans as pushy and selfish . what causes these persistent misunderst andings , and what can be done to avoid them ? fluent in both languages and at home in both cultures , haru yamada brings an insiders perspective and a linguists training to this difficult question , illuminating the many reasons why americans and japanese misunderstand one another . social organization , she explains , shapes the way we talk . because american and japanese cultures value different kinds of social relationships , they play different language games with different sets of rules . in america , for instance , aesop 's fable about the grasshopper and the ants ends with the ants scorning the foolhardy grasshopper . in japan , however , the story has a very different ending : the ants invite the grasshopper in to share their winter meal , as they appreciate how his singing spurred them on during their summer labors . in the difference between these two endings , argues yamada , lies an important lesson : americans , because of their unique political history , value independence and individuality , while japanese value mutual dependency and interconnectedness . the language of both cultures is designed to display and reinforce these values so that words , phrases and expressions in one language can have completely different connotations in another , leading to all manner of misunderstanding . yamada provides numerous examples . in japan , for instance , silence is valued and halting speech is considered more honest and thoughtful than fluid speech , while in america forthright , polished speech is valued . likewise , the japanese use word order to express emphasis , while americans use vocal stress : a listener unaware of this difference may easily misunderstand the import of a sentence . in a lucid and insightful discussion , yamada outlines the basic differences between japanese and american english and analyzes a number of real-life business and social interactions in which these differences led to miscommunication . by understanding how and why each culture speaks in the way that it does , yamada shows , we can learn to avoid frustrating and damaging failures of communication . different games , different rules is essential reading for anyone who travels to or communicates regularly with japan , whether they are scientists , scholars , tourists , or business executives . but as deborah tannen notes in her foreword to the book , even those who will never travel to japan , do business with a japanese company , or talk to a person from that part of the world , will find the insights of this book illuminating and helpful , because the greatest benefit that comes of understanding another culture is a better and deeper understanding of one 's own . april 1997 192 pp . 0-19 - 509488 - 3 $ 24 . 00 oxford university press an introduction to the languages of the world anatole v . lyovin , university of hawaii at manoa "" the author succeeds in covering a broad range of important and interesting information , and i am not aware of any other work that could serve as an all-round textbook for a course on the languages of the world .

Subject: facial information processing  call for papers pragmatics & cognition announces a special issue on facial information processing : a multidisciplinary perspective guest editors itiel e . dror and sarah v . stevenage in many senses , faces are at the center of human interaction . at a very basic level , faces indicate identity . however , faces are remarkably rich information carriers . for example , facial gestures may be used as means of conveying intentions . faces may also permit a direct glimpse into the person 's inner self ( by unintentionally revealing , for example , aspects of character or mood ) . given their salient role , the processing of the information conveyed by faces and its integration with other sources of interactional information raise important issues in cognition and pragmatics . research on facial information processing has investigated these ( and other ) issues utilizing a variety of approaches and methodologies , and developments in both computer and cognitive sciences have recently carried this research forward . the emerging picture is that there are cognitive subsystems which specialize in different aspects of facial processing . this has been supported by neuropsychological evidence suggesting that brain damaged patients show dissociations between the different aspects of face processing . in addition , research on the development of facial processing abilities , and on aspects of the face itself which affect these processing abilities , has contributed to our understanding of how facial information is perceived . this special issue of pragmatics and cognition is intended to provide a common forum for a variety of the topics currently under investigation . given the breadth of issues and approaches used to investigate faces , we encourage submissions from a wide range of disciplines . our aim is that this special issue will tie together the diverse research on faces , and show their links and interdependencies . deadline for submission : august 1 , 1998 editorial decisions : november 1 , 1998 revised papers due : february 1 , 1999 expected publication : october 1999 papers should be submitted according to the guidelines of the journal ( see www url : http : / / www . cogsci . soton . ac . uk / ~ dror / guideline . html ) . all submissions will be peer reviewed . please send five copies of your submission either to : dr . itiel dror ( dror @ coglab . psy . soton . ac . uk ) or : dr . sarah stevenage ( svs1 @ soton . ac . uk ) dept . of psychology southampton university highfield , southampton so17 1bj england for additional and updated information see www url : http : / / www . cogsci . soton . ac . uk / ~ dror / faces . html or contact either of the guest editors . # = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = # | itiel e . dror , ph . d . http : / / www . cogsci . soton . ac . uk / ~ dror / | | department of psychology dror @ coglab . psy . soton . ac . uk | | university of southampton office 44 ( 0 ) 1703 594519 | | highfield , southampton lab . 44 ( 0 ) 1703 594518 | | england so17 1bj fax . 44 ( 0 ) 1703 594597 | # = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = # * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 	0

"Subject: lrec workshop announcement  adapting lexical and corpus resources to sublanguages and applications a workshop to be held at the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 26 may 1998 the workshop will provide a forum for those researchers involved in the development of methods to integrate corpora and mrds , with the aim of adding adaptive capabilities to existing linguistic resources . organisers : roberto basili ( university of roma "" tor vergata "" ) , roberta catizone ( university of sheffield ) , maria teresa pazienza ( university of roma "" tor vergata "" ) , paola velardi ( university of roma "" la sapienza ) , yorick wilks ( university of sheffield ) workshop scope and aims lexicons , i . e . , those components of a nlp system that contain "" computable "" information about words , cannot be considered as static objects . words may behave very differently in different domains , and there are language phenomena that do not generalize across sublanguages . lexicons are a snapshot of a given stage of development of a language , normally provided without support for adaptation changes , whether caused by language creativity and development or the shift to such a previously unencountered domain . the divergence of corpus usages from lexical norms has been studied computationally at least since the late sixties , but only recently has the availability of large on-line corpora made it possible to establish methods to cope systematically with this problem . an emerging branch of research is now involved in studies and experiments on corpus-driven linguistics , with the aim of complementing and extending earlier work on lexicon acquisition based on machine readable dictionaries ( mrd ) : data are extracted from texts , as embodiments of language in use , so as to capture lexical regularities and to code them into operational forms . the purpose of this workshop will be to provide an updated snapshot of current work in the area , and promote discussion of how to make progress . central topics will be ( though this list is in no way exclusive ) : * corpus-driven tuning of mrds to optimize domain-specific inferences , * terminology and jargon acquisition , * sense extensions , * acquisition of preference or subcategorization information from corpora * taxonomy adaptation , * statistical weighting of senses etc . to domains * use of mrds to provide explanations of linguistic phenomena in corpora * what is the scope of "" lexical tuning "" * the evaluation of lexical tuning as a separate task , or as part of a more generic task industrial panel * * * new * * * * automatic adaptation of lexicons to new domains through the use of application corpora makes nlp applications more adaptable and portable . the program commettee is organizing a joint panel to discuss this ( and other ) issues concerning next generation information extraction systems . the panel intends to bring industrial representatives to confront expectations in ie from their viewpoint and degree of maturity of the offering . the following ( and other ) issues will be discussed : - is there a market for ie ? - what is the demand in domains such as new services for the citizens , telecommunications , management support , etc ? - what are the technical requirements ? is the technology near to the market ? program committee yorick wilks university of sheffield roberta catizone university of sheffield paola velardi university of roma "" la sapienza "" maria teresa pazienza university of roma "" tor vergata "" roberto basili university of roma "" tor vergata "" bran boguraev brandeis university sergei nirenburg new mexico state university james pustejowsky brandeis university ralph grishman new york university christiane fellbaum princeton university paper submission formatting guidelines : papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . hard copies : three hard copies should be sent to : paola velardi dipartimento di scienza dell ' informazione via salaria 113 00198 roma italy electronic submission : electronic submission will be allowed in poscript or word per mac or rtf . an ftp site will be available on demand . authors should send an info email to paola velardi ( velardi @ dsi . uniroma1 . it ) even important dates * * * * * ( please note extended deadline ) * * * * * * paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) march 10 paper notification april 1 camera - ready papers due april 20 l&ct workshop may 26 prof . paola velardi dipartimento di scienza dell ' informazione via salaria 113 universita ' "" la sapienza "" 00198 roma ph . + 39 - ( 0 ) 6-49918356 fax + 39 - ( 0 ) 6-8541842 8841964 "	0

Subject: when voices clash : a study in literary pragmatics , j . l . mey  jacob l . mey when voices clash a study in literary pragmatics 1998 . 23 x 15 , 5 cm . xv , 454 pages cloth dm 208 , - / approx . us $ 130 . 00 isbn 3-11 - 015820 - 5 trends in linguistics . studies and monographs 115 mouton de gruyter * berlin * new york what is the basic difference between a good and a bad novel ? what makes us lose the ` thread ' of the story ( and interest in the plot and the character ) ? what is it that interrupts the necessary process of continuously re-creating the text that are so crucial for text consumption and successful readership ? the answer to these questions revolves around the notion of voice , understood not only as the way a character speaks but , even more so , the way a character expresses a particular view of the world . a voice represents an ( implicit or explicit ) point of view , a focus . vocalization implies focalization , as the author says in the book . the clashing of voices that the title highlights happens when characters run off the story track and , by doing so , derail the entire narrative engine . the book inquires into the ways in which those collisions and derailments are caused , observed , and possibly repaired . the role of the reader is here paramount in making or breaking the narrative . the book examines the various linguistic and narrative-technical ` tricks ' that the reader has at his or her disposal in order to successfully follow the narrative and keep the thread of the narrative intact . while dealing with a pragmatic problem in literary theory , the book nevertheless is written in such a fashion that also non-initiated readers , taking an interest in the machinery of the reading process , may consult it with profit . whatever claims are made in the book are shored up by lenghty extracts from literary works , from horace to fupz aakesson , from caesar to tolstoy , by way of woolf , bulgakov , wesley , byatt , and numerous others . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ mouton de gruyter walter de gruyter , inc . postfach 30 34 21 200 saw mill river road d-10728 berlin hawthorne , ny 10532 germany usa fax : + 49 ( 0 ) 30 26005-351 fax : + 1 914 747-1326 email : mouton @ degruyter . de publications by de gruyter can also be ordered via world wide web : http : / / www . degruyter . com 	0

Subject: language instinct  isbn : 0 304 33908 3 , are we creatures who learn new things ? or does human mental development consist of awakening structures of thought ? a view has gained ground - powerfully advocated , for example , by stephen pinker 's book the language instinct - that language in much of its detail is hard wired in our genes . others add that this holds too much of the specific knowledge and understanding expressed in language . when the first human eve evolved from pre-human apes ( it is claimed ) , her biological inheritance comprised not just a distinctive anatomy but a rich structure of cognition . despite the impressive roll of converts that these ideas have gained , there is no good reason to believe them . pinker 's and other 's arguments depend on earlier and more technical contributions , by writers such as noam chomsky . many readers take these foundations on trust , not realising how weak they are . this book examines the various arguments for instinctive knowledge , and finds that each one rests on false premises or embodies a logical fallacy . a different picture of learning is suggested by karl popper 's account of knowledge growing through ' conjectures and refutations ' . the facts of human language are best explained by taking language acquisition to be a case of popperian learning . eve was not born a know-all . she was born knowing nothing , but able to learn anything . that is why we can find ways to think and talk about a world that goes on changing today . geoffrey sampson is a reader in computer science and artifical intelligence at the unibersity of essex , uk . this book is priced 45 pounds and is available at any good bookshop or in case of difficulty contact cassell on 01202 665432 . thanks very much joanne coen , cassell 	0

Subject: disc : grammar in uk schools  forwarded message - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i have recently received , by a rather roundabout route , just a few of the contributions to this discussion . i do n't , therefore , know everything that has been said . i teach advanced level english language ( as well as a separate course in english literature ) at a sixth form college - i . e . to students aged 16 + . they come to us from 80 + different schools , so have a wide range of previous educational experience . far from arriving having been taught to avoid splitting infinitives and ending sentences with prepositions , most arrive having never been taught what infinitives and prepositions are . they lack the ` reasonably precise vocabulary for analysis ' referred to by larry rosenwald in his contribution of 5 june . i can teach them the terminology from scratch , but find that it does not ` bed down ' as it would have done if they had been familiar with basic grammatical concepts from a much earlier age . a few days ago , i spent a whole lesson teaching my students to distinguish between active and passive verbs ( something which i myself could have done easily at the age of 12 , thanks to the ` old-fashioned ' grammar teaching which i received ) because i wanted them to try an old exam question where the knowledge would have helped them to see which of two texts would have been harder for young children to read . i ended up nursing them through the . exercise , doing much of the work for them . in the next lesson , i gave them another old exam question with extracts from ` animal farm ' to analyse in the light of orwell 's own suggestion ( amongst others ) that one should prefer the active to the passive . many of the students took so long to decide which verbs were active and which passive that they had no time to write an analysis . a recurring problem on the course is that students struggle with higher-order analysis because they lack lower-order skills . teachers in the past at least had the grace to teach children how to recognise infinitives and prepositions : they described before they prescribed or proscribed . now , however , most teachers seem so anxious to avoid prescription and proscription that they avoid even description . like larry rosenwald , i think that the prescriptivist / descriptivist dichotomy has been taken too far . jennifer chew - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - end of forwarded message - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 	0

- - - - - - - - - constraint - based theories of phonology have become enormously popular in recent years . such theories express generalizations by stating how and when a language 's phonological forms are constrained , rather than relying on rules that actively modify the forms . computational ideas have often provided an impetus for these innovations . koskenniemi 's ( 1983 ) 2 - level morphophonological processor introduced parallel constraining relations as an alternative to an ordered system of rewrite rules . declarative phonology ( c 1990 ) focusses on the unity of representations and rules as constraints , drawing on various computational ideas from unification to temporal logic to finite-state calculi . one current constraint-based theory is optimality theory ( ot ) ( prince&smolensky 1993 ) . this theory found , at least partial , inspiration in computational work by smolensky on the relation between symbolic and subsymbolic computation . although this link with connectionism has been left largely unexplored , ot has proved to be a computationally productive theory , giving rise to several theoretical papers on computational issues related to complexity and learnability , as well as inspiring a number of implementations . this workshop is designed to foster the link between computational work and constraint-based phonology in general . to this end , it invites submissions on topics related to the computation of any constraint-based phonological formalism , including but not limited to the three mentioned above . here are some example topics : * the computational interpretation of phonological theories , * constraint ranking and interaction , eg . as in ot , * implementations of particular analyses , * results in the complexity of constraint application , * algorithms for learning constraints or constraint ranking , * results on the learnability of such constraints , * novel formalisms for constraint-based phonology , * representational issues raised by constraint-based approaches . in short , papers are invited which address computational issues in constraint-based theories of phonology . submission -

345 225225 . a seat reservation often comes with the ticket if you request it . trains take two hours from london ( king 's cross station ; trains leave every half hour during the working day ) ; two hours from manchester airport ( trains leave every hour at 20 past during the working day , every two hours during the night ) ; an hour and ten minutes from hull . york railway station is a short walk or taxi ride from king 's manor and the surrounding area . travel by bus . long distance buses stop at rougier street close to the railway station and / or at exhibition square , right beside king 's manor . travel by air : the easiest route is to fly to manchester , which has direct connections to many european and north american cities . in manchester , the airport and the train station are in the same place , so you can easily walk from the plane to the train . a train ticket with return between manchester and york costs about gbp 21 . 00 . see information above for travel time and train frequency . you can fly to the leeds / bradford airport , which is about 30 miles from york . although there is train service between leeds and york , you must take a taxi from the airport to the train station . an easier option is a prebooked taxi from leeds / bradford to york , which costs about gbp 40 . 00 with return . we will prebook taxis if you request it ; send a message to digs @ york . ac . uk ; the message should request a taxi booking , and it should include your name , e-mail address , flight numbers , and date and time for arrival and departure . you can fly to heathrow airport , but it is a bit more difficult to get from heathrow to york . from heathrow , take the underground ( piccadilly line ) to king 's cross station , and then take the train from king 's cross to york . the underground trip takes about an hour , and the train trip takes about two hours ; overall travel time is therefore about three hours , plus time for connections . tickets from london (

Subject: grammar in schools  i 'd like to second herb stahlke 's plea , following his brief survey of the decline in grammar teaching ( which mirrors the events in uk ) . > i also teach an undergrad english linguistics course that , for many > students , is the only brush with grammar in the entire english ed . > program . i find that these students , many of them well prepared and > highly motivated , have had little or no grammar in k12 . this is not > surprising , since they were taught by teachers who were taught to > believe that the teaching of grammar served no purpose . if they were > taught it at all , little effort was made to make grammar make sense or > seem relevant and interesting . they will become teachers with > probablly less understanding of and ability to teach grammar than even > the generation before them . > > how do we reverse this ? certainly not by either replacing grammar > with even more abstract and difficulty linguistic subject matter . > we ' re not going to see change without concerted efforts by linguists > to work together with educators , school boards and legislators to make > people aware of the nature of grammar as an academic subject . the lsa > has a standing committee on this topic , but i havent ' been able to > find out much about their activities or positions from the lsa > literature or web page . we have the responsibility and the knowledge > to bring about change in grammar education , but we do n't have any sort > of unified , concerted effort to do so . the same posting also carried a similar message from larry rosenwald , who describes his attempts to help students to write better : > what i do care about is having a > reasonably precise vocabulary for analysis . since this strand arose out of a discussion of a recent trial in uk of some materials for testing pupils ' knowledge of grammar , readers may be interested in the background . recent developments in uk are interesting and ( to my mind ) potentially very positive , in spite of having been introduced for quite the wrong reasons ( by a right-wing government aiming at a return to ` basics ' ) . the official national curriculum requires * all * schools to teach grammar . the most obvious statement of this requirement is under the heading ` writing ' for secondary schools ( specifically , leading up to ages 14 and 16 ) : ` pupils should be encouraged broaden their understanding of the principles of sentence grammar and be taught to organise whole texts effectively . [ note the stress on understanding grammar as well as on applying this understanding . ] pupils should be given opportunities to analyse their own writing , reflecting on the meaning and clarity of individual sentences , using appropriate terminology , and so be given opportunities to learn about : - discourse structure - the structure of whole texts - paragraph structure ; how different types of praragraphs are formed ; openings and closings in different kinds of writing ; - phrase , clause and sentence structure - the use of complex grammatical structures and the linking of structures through appropriate connective ; the use of main and subordinate clauses and phrases ; - words - components including stem , prefix , suffix , inflection ; grammatical functions of nouns , verbs , adjectives , adverbs , pronouns , prepositions , conjunctions and demonstratives ; - punctuation - the use of the full range of punctuation marks , including full stops , question and exclamation marks , commas , semi-colons , colons , . . ' as a linguist i have very few arguments with this list ( given its purpose etc ) . it 's also recognised that teachers themselves need to be trained to do this kind of work . but it 's rather ambitious , and the teachers ( and teacher-trainers ) need help from the professionals - i . e . us . i think a lot of us in the uk would be interested to hear from colleagues in other countries where school grammar is fed more directly by academic grammar . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = richard ( = dick ) hudson department of phonetics and linguistics , university college london , gower street , london wc1e 6bt work phone : + 171 419 3152 ; work fax : + 171 383 4108 email : dick @ ling . ucl . ac . uk web-sites : home page = http : / / www . phon . ucl . ac . uk / home / dick / home . htm unpublished papers available by ftp = . . . . uk / home / dick / papers . htm 	0

"Subject: 8 . 859 , disc : punctuation  john phillips ( 8 . 859 ) asks , with respect to apostrophised plurals , e . g . "" dyslexic 's "" , "" sonata 's "" , < < exactly what are the grounds for condemning this usage ? > > one of the joys of linguistlist is that only here could such a question be asked , and from an academic address . it was , i think , benji wald who perceptively remarked , in the ebonics debate , that linguists , and only linguists , believe in the equal value of all language forms . perhaps i might widen the question to "" what are the grounds for condemning particular variations in human symbolic behaviour ( vocabulary , accent , spelling , non - si units , facial hair , clothes , tied or untied laces ) ? "" alas , the answer is not universalistic , and comes down to one of two tyrannical reasons : because it ' ll harm your job prospects ; and , even more tyrannical : because your peers will make fun of you . it depends on who you take as your reference group ( "" whom "" for american readers ) , and how much you feel like a fight . a lot of academic linguists are in fact not neutral on this issue - - they want a sort of compensatory justice for the usage of disadvantaged groups , "" threatened languages "" like their biologist colleagues ' "" threatened species "" .

"Subject: ecology of language acquisition  ecology of language acquisition international research workshop university of amsterdam , netherlands 11 - 15 january 1999 second announcement and call for papers ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ this workshop re-examines certain assumptions implicit in much language acquisition research to date , such as the primacy of the one-speaker - one-hearer interaction ; a static interpretation of ' context ' and participant roles ; and the presupposition of a monolingual / monocultural social matrix . the focus of the meeting is thus the complexity of circumstances in which the language acquirer operates , addressed in such questions as : * how should discourse-analytic and anthropological descriptions of communicative interaction be integrated to account not only for ' conversation ' , multi-party and ritual talk , but also man-machine interaction and forms of virtual participation in the networks of cyberspace ? * how should the notion of 's hared context ' be extended to capture the floor shifts and on-line construction of meaning that take place over the progress of an unfolding discourse ? * how can theories of acquisition be made more sensitive to complex linguistic and sociocultural environments that are to varying degrees plural , mixed , and in flux ? the intention is to bring together people and paradigms from l1 and l2 acquisition research with the aim of exploring from an empirical base how the multiple contexts of language acquisition are interrelated , and how , with ecosystemic validity , such interrelations may be theoretically modelled . in the planning of the programme the organizers are assisted by a scientific advisory board consisting of eve clark ( max planck insitute / stanford ) , claire kramsch ( berkeley ) , leo van lier ( monterey ) , ben rampton ( thames valley ) and remco scha ( amsterdam ) - all of whom have also agreed to contribute keynote talks . if you would like to propose a paper , please send in an abstract ( maximum 300 words ) by e-mail before 30 april . the address is : ecolang @ hum . uva . nl ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ although we are obliged to limit ' real ' participation to 30 people , we are making provision for a form of remote partial participation via e-mail ( with possible audio links ) . if you think you will be interested in participating in either capacity , please let us know by e-mail . the workshop fee ( for "" live "" participants ) will be dfl . 160 ( approximately us $ 75 ) . the workshop is organized by jet van dam , jonathan leather , anne bannink ( faculty of humanities , university of amsterdam ) http : / / www . hum . uva . nl / ~ ecolang "	0

and tone delimited the sentences . the synthetic elements that still characterize many languages started but as analytic elements . for example , the b - past tense prefix in basque began life as a a simple adverb , ba , meaning "" already "" , and before that , simply "" over "" . the ie e-augment for non-concommitant verbal forms started out as simply the adverb * e , "" then "" , and before that "" there ( 3rd p . deixis ) "" . the formant - i / y , which forms adjectives in so many languages , was first the noun "" word "" , which acquired the meaning "" like "" . many languages like ie have factitive forms that are simply - - at origin - - combinations of the verb stem and an element meant "" it "" , in ie yo . the aa second person singular - k is simply a word for "" male "" . with this history behind us , it is difficult to believe that constructions like "" have done "" will not , at some some future , develop into v-prefix perfects . nietzsche , of course , said it far more eloquently , but the modern phrase "" what goes around , comes around "" expresses it quite well also . language , like all of existence , is not unidirectional . it has a direction only in the same sense that a very small segment of a circle appears to be straight . what really separates "" primitive "" languages from advanced ones , is the insistence of nominative-type ( g . a . klimov ) languages on an overtly expressed transitive subject . the mindset that this produces is directly responsible for the scientific approach that has resulted in the technology of the late 20th century . however we may wish to theorize , it is a fact that the scientific advances that have us all in a state of perpetual uneasiness , have come about through scientists who speak nominative-type languages , or who got their training in nominative-type languages . science is simply a matter of correctly linking cause and effect . nominative - type language are used to organizing their thoughts by reflex into a cause and effect algorithm . that is not to say that speakers of other languages cannot organize their thoughts logically . but logic and what constitutes a logical approach is culturally determined . factors that nt - speakers would reject as not directly causal would be difficult to eradicate from the "" logic "" of thinkers in other non - nt - speaking cultural matrices . the single advantage that synthetic languages have is freer word order , which can be economically employed for emphasizing or topicalizing selected elements of the sentence . but every analytic language with rigid word order has other devices to accomplish the same purpose . pat - patrick c . ryan < proto-language @ worldnet . att . net > ( 501 ) 227-9947 ;

"" m . h . columbus , ohio note : ( testimonial section has full unsolicited letters from customers that have used the auto program . ) whether you have bad credit and can not get financed , or if you have excellent credit and want to eliminate the downpayment or security deposit without increasing the monthly payment , the auto program will work for you . requirements : you must be currently employed or have a source of income and be able to make monthly payments on time . that 's it ! no car salesman to deal with ! you do not have to deal with the normal stress related to dealing with a car salesman . this also means you do not have to deal with getting rejected because of bad credit or having to take a car that is older and not the car you really want . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ easy to use just follow the simple , step by step , directions in the auto program and obtain the late model vehicle you want . that is how easy the auto program is to use . it explains everything you need to know to obtain the late model vehicle of your choice with no downpayment or security deposit required . just pay normal monthly car payments . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ savings to you : the auto program will save you between $ 500 to $ 5000 dollars since you will not be required to put a down payment or security deposit on the vehicle you obtain . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ no risk , 100 % money-back guarantee the 100 % money-back guarantee is in writing in the auto program . you can return the auto program anytime within 30 days for a full refund if you are not able to obtain a late model vehicle with no downpayment or security deposit . this guarantee is regardless of your credit history as long as you use the simple methods in the auto program . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ frequently asked questions q : how long does it take to obtain a vehicle once i receive the auto program ? a : it is all up to you and how quickly you actively use the methods provided in the auto program . example : eric brown from columbus , oh , ordered the auto program on a monday and on friday of the same week he called to tell us he obtained the vehicle he wanted . q : is this program just for people with bad or no credit ? a : no , the auto program is also for people with good credit who do not want to put down the normally required downpayment . the auto program shows you how to obtain the vehicle of your choice with no money down . so , you can use your money saved from not paying a downpayment to buy better things ! q : i can lease a car or truck from a car dealership without a down payment . . . just pay monthly lease payments . why do i need the auto program ? a : many of our customers have thought that , until they tried to lease a car from a dealership . first , you must have excellent credit to lease a car or truck . with a lease , you have to put down a security deposit , first and last lease payments , and capitalized cost reduction which is the same thing as a down payment . . . just a different name ! when you lease a car from a dealership , you have to put down the same or more as when you buy a car ! q : the monthly car payments must be high since there is no downpayment required , right ? a : the monthly car payments are the regular amount . it is just the same as if someone paid a downpayment , but through our revolutionary method , no downpayment is needed . q : is the auto program too good to be true ? a : the step-by - step methods in the auto program have been approved by my lawyer and have been market tested by many satisfied customers . i am so confident you will benefit from the auto program that i put my name and a 100 % money-back guarantee behind it ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ testimonials mr . kevin cross , it is with great pleasure that i give my warmest appreciation to your company for providing me with the necessary tools to successfully secure a late model chevy cavalier using the 1st and most preferred method . i purchase the program on january 3 , and secured a vehicle on january 6 ; likewise , i had more than one option available to me ! i also had to opportunity to assume the lease on a late model acura legend or assume the lease on a late model bmw . but , of course , i made the wisest and most financially sound decision and purchased the chevy cavalier . . . . in closing , i graciously thank you and wish you continued success in your quest to help others . professionally , d . s . + + + dear gentlemen : . . . i am writing to tell you of my good fortune in acquiring a new ford escort wagon from ricart ford . i think that your program did help instill some confidence in me that i could get a new car . at least i knew that i had to do something about the piece of junk i was driving . thank you for your assistance in helping me realize my dream of owning a new vehicle . i still can't believe my good fortune . i am leasing the car for two years with an option to buy at a fixed rate from ford motor credit . again , thank you for your assistance . respectfully yours , c . b . + + + _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the auto program sells for $ 59 . 95 , but take advantage of this internet offer and order for only $ 29 . 95 ! ! ! + + + order the auto program now for $ 29 . 95 ( plus $ 2 . 90 s / h ) + + + order today and i will include two valuable reports , free ! l . getting good automotive service 2 . nine ways to lower your auto insurance cost order now : call to order toll free : 888 324-1873 or ( 614 ) 529-1390 pay with personal check , visa , or mastercard right over the phone . for any questions pertaining to the auto program , call ( 614 ) 529-1390 please be patient when calling to order . if you have any difficulty connecting , please try again later . or send payment to : kevin cross 1773 hobbes drive hilliard , ohio 43026 i would like to say to anyone that might doubt whether the auto program will really work for them , i completely understand . i have bought a lot of how-to information manuals that were complete hype and did not have valuable information . if the auto program was not already proven to work , i would not have my name and a money-back guarantee in writing in the auto program . # # # # # # # # # # under bill s . 1618 title iii passed by the 105th u . s . congress , this e-mail is in compliance with the law . to remove your name from our list , please reply to this e-mail with the subject line "" remove .

"Subject: re : 8 . 764 , disc : noam chomsky : a life of dissent  i read robert f . barsky 's reply to postal 's and pullum 's comments about feargul murphy 's review of his ( barsky 's ) book and found it odd , to say the least . about three quarters of barsky 's reply do ( does ? ) not deal with the postal - pullum comments about murphy 's review for the linguist but with a review by pullum for ' nature ' of barsky 's book . i can understand that barsky feels the need to defend himself against pullum ( who would n't ) , but most of what he says is simply irrelevant to the issue at hand . postal & pullum wrote a reply to murphy , not to barsky . but even granting that this was a welcome opportunity for barsky to reply to pullum 's ' nature ' review , i see no justification for the fact that this reply deals almost exclusively with chomsky 's non-linguistic activities , which were not at issue in p&p 's reply to murphy . p&p are concerned with what they take to be inaccuracies being spread by murphy ( and barsky ) about one specific issue : the politics of the mit linguistics department at a certain point in history . p&p mention chomsky 's non-academic political activities only very briefly , and only insofar as they are relevant to chomsky the linguist : they concern murphy 's strangely irrelevant remark that "" chomsky was at this time simply very busy with other issues like the vietnam war "" . ( i can only understand this remark , which is quoted by p&p as paraphrasing barsky , as insinuating that one ought not criticize chomsky 's academic politics because from someone who has the courage to speak out against the vietnam war anything goes ) . the following comment by barsky summarizes for me the tone and tenor of his entire reply : "" pullum seems to want to tell all of us what to do and how to think . "" this is not an argument , it 's low-level denigration . it reminds me of presidential debates . to quote barsky : "" this is extremely unnerving .

"Subject: sum : particle movement  dear linguist listers , about a month ago i posted a query regarding literature on ' particle movement ' in english or , to be more precise , literature on factors contributing to the position of the particle in transitive phrasal-verb constructions such as ( 1 ) a . john brought back the book . b . john brought the book back . in the beginning , i 'd like to thank very much all of those who responded and shared their knowledge with me . apart from some very valuable hints i even received offers to send me unpublished papers or to share the up to now unpublished results of recent research concerning the topic in question . additionally , some answers were suggestions concerning methodological matters or exceptions from the rules generally cited . now that i have managed to mail my answers to all of them individually ( my sincere apologies to those who had had to wait unexpectedly long for their answers ) i want to post the summary of all those who contributed to my research followed by their suggestions or references ( in alphabetical order ) : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - aarts , bas ( b . aarts @ ucl . ak . uk ) : dear stefan gries , regarding your query on linguist , you may want to have a look at a paper of mine in the journal of linguistics , 25 . 2 , 1989 , 277-290 : ` verb - preposition constructions and small clauses in english ' ( and references cited there ) . this article also appears in modified form in my book _ small clauses in english : the nonverbal types _ . new york and berlin : mouton de gruyter . 1992 . hope this is helpful . bas aarts cameron , richard ( rcameron @ uic . edu ) for an article which investigates "" the factors contributing to the position of the particle "" , see : kroch , anthony and cathy small . 1978 . grammatical ideology and its effect on speech . in david sankoff ( ed . ) linguistic variation : models and methods . new york : academic press . pp . 45-55 . good luck . richard cameron durham . linguistics @ durham . ac . uk ( durham linguistics ) you might like to look at : johnson , k . 1991 . object positions . _ natural language and linguistic theory _ 9 : 577-636 . fischer , susan ( currently : fischer @ sal . tohoku . ac . jp ) i did my 1971 - 2 mit dissertation on the acquisition of verb-particle constructions as well as double-object constructions in english . i do not have a copy of my dissertation ( the acquisition of verb - particle and dative constructions ) with me here on sabbatical , but the main point of the structure chapter was that unstressed pronoun direct objects are cliticized to the verb - - so you must say "" i gave it up "" rather than "" i gave up it "" . however , if the pronoun has inherent or contrastive stress , the particle can intervene between the verb and the object : "" ok i gave up that a long time ago "" , "" i gave up him , he did n't give up me . "" good luck with your work . susan fischer foster , joseph f . ( joseph . foster @ uc . edu ) mr . gries , re your query on linguist re bring np back and structures of that ilk , i believe chomsky actually used this as one of his examples motivating transformations in syntactic structures . nelson francis also did in his structure of american english which was basically an immediate constituent analysis a la rulon wells . my chief reason for returning your signal however is to let you know if you do n't already ( as your signal suggests you may not ) that there is certainly a dialect of english in which the particle must always follow a pronoun direct object . thus your ( 2 ) b * * * john picked up him . is never grammatical in my english ( i speak natively ozark english but am fluent in standard southern american and pretty fair in midwestern . ) even if the him be contrastively stressed , it can never follow the particle . on the other hand , your 1 a and b are both ok . joe foster fraser , bruce ( bfraser @ bu . edu ) if you get any answers to your query , i would appreciate learning of the article . good luck . bruce fraser hagstrom ( hagstrom @ scf . usc . edu ) try hawkins ' "" performance theory of order and constituency "" cambridge university press 1994 for a processing approach to word order . cynthia hawkins , john ( hawkins @ almaak . usc . edu ) hi stefan : i saw your question on the linguist list re particle positioning . i have quite a bit of discussion on the ordering of verb , particle and np in my 1994 book a performance theory of order and constituency , cup , pp . 180-182 , and also some textual data . in the meantime i have collected a whole bunch more data , and have examined the constituent structure of v-np - part sequences in greater detail , and have found ordering evidence for two quite distinct structures here : one i analyze as a predication structure in which the part is semantically a predication ( e . g . lift the child up = the child is up ) ; one in which it is not and which i analyze as a discontinuous verb-particle structure ( look the number up does not equal the number is up ) . the proposed constituency difference predicts different orderings in conjunction with the basic ordering principle of my book ( early immediate constituents ) . i have n't got this stuff written up yet , but i ' ll be happy to share it with you when i have . best wishes , john hawkins kemmer , suzanne e . ( kemmer @ ruf . rice . edu ) i ' m happy to hear you ' re going to work on english particles . i do n't have any references to give you , only a suggestion : the generative work on particles was not very empirical , and never actually looked at the distribution of the verb adjacent vs . the postnominal particle . the distribution is highly lexically governed . ( for example , i have many times heard ' look over it ' instead of ' look it over ' , although all the generative literature assumes only ' look it over ' , because of the pronoun . the fact is , ' look over ' is coalescing into a single unit that overrides the pronoun-first preference . ) so , my suggestion is , get yourself a concordance program and actually look at large samples of english . it 's true , it will be written data ( unless you have a spoken corpus ) , and as such more conservative and somewhat less open to the innovations people actually make ; but some real generalizations will emerge . you can search on the various particles ( throwing out the prepositional uses ) and get an idea of which verbs like which particles . ( if you need suggestions on inexpensive concordance programs , let me know ) good luck , suzanne mills , carl ( carl . mills @ uc . edu ) at the 21st forum of the linguistic association of canada and the united states ( lacus ) , i presented a paper entitled "" ' obligatory particle movement ' in english , "" which is available on pp . 195-204 of the papers from the 21st lacus forum , ed . by mava jo powell . i wrote the paper because i had come across several examples in normal english conversation that violated your starred example : ( 2 ) a . john picked him up . b . * john picked up him . because these were examples that i overheard , some on national public radio , i knew that your stipulation "" ( 2b ) is starred unless ' him ' is contrastively stressed "" did not hold : the pronoun around which the particle was supposed to have been "" moved "" was not contrastively stressed . within a matter of days , i overheard three sentences : he wanted to help out them . he went in the house and put down something . can you ring up this ? i added 21 more sentences , some that i made up and some that had been starred in various linguistics publications , and conducted an acceptability judgment survey using a written questionnaire . statistically , the results indicated that speakers accept the sort of rule that underlies your starring of ( 2b ) above , but they do n't always obey the rule . there is more , but you can read the paper for that . good luck . carl mills nathan , geoff ( geoffn @ siu . edu ) dear stefan , a number of years ago we had a student work on this problem , and she wrote a thesis using an early version of cognitive grammar . she finished her thesis , and unfortunately dropped out of linguistics - - i do n't even know where she is now . but i could send you a copy of her thesis if that would be of use to you . best , geoff nathan nolan , brian ( bnolan @ iol . ie ) you may find what you need in the works of talmy , listed below . talmy explores the windowing of attention and the linguistic correlates which pertain to this phenonema . he explains how we can bring to attention , or focus , certain features in a dialogue and how these can manifest themselves linguistically via foregrounding and backgrounding , gapping etc . , etc . talmy 's ( 1996a ) , or his ( 1985 ) work is probably a good place to start talmy , leonard .

"" the book back "" would be a small clause , in your example ) and relates particle shift to heavy np shift ; the particle moves to the right when it is phonologically "" heavy "" . i adopted the small clause configuration from kayne but criticized the heavy np shift approach to the word order variation in a 1992 article , and proposed a technical syntactic solution for particle shift ( based on the particle "" incorporating "" into the verb ) . den dikken , in his 1992 dissertation ( later published as den dikken 1995 ) agreed with my rejection of kayne 's analysis but tendered some accurate criticism of my approach , and offered a different syntatic analysis , which also adopts the small clause structure but which in which shift is characterized as np movement across the particle for case reasons . in my 1994 dissertation , i accept den dikken 's criticism of my 1992 analysis but show some evidence that the base structure he assumes is incorrect . i propose another syntactic account based on two alternative movements ; either the particle moves or the np moves . in later work i have developed this approach and extended it to the scandinavian languages . i have one article published in 1996 in working papers in scandinavian syntax and a longer one that has n't been published anywhere ( yet ! ) . i also have a review of den dikken 's book published in the journal language . two additional recent references are johnson 's 1991 ( ? ) article in natural language and linguistic theory , in which the verb plus particle start out as a constituent , and the verb moves from the particle ( as in most analyses of german and dutch ) , and collins & thrainsson 's 1996 linguistic inquiry article , in which the particle first moves up to attach to the verb , as in my 1992 article , and then the verb moves away , as in johnson . all of the above works deal to some extent with the basic pattern of shift , which is that pronouns precede the particle and modified particles ( and particles with complements ) follow the noun phrase - - with greater or lesser degrees of success . for example , pronouns are often considered to have special properties with respect to case , and this has been exploited in several of the above works . in my dissertation , i speculate somewhat inconclusively that the special positioning of pronouns may be due to their prosodic lightness , and i expand on that possibility in the wpss article , where i show that destressed nps are best before the particle , while stressed nps are better after the particle , e . g . ( 1 ) how with the girls get here ? a . i ' ll pick the girls up b . * i ' ll pick up the girls c . i ' ll pick up the girls ( 2 ) who will you pick up ? a . i ' ll pick up the girls b . * i ' ll pick the girls up c . i ' ll pick the girls up in each case , the ( a ) example is best , because the natural right-edge pitch increase coincides with an element that is not old information . the ( b ) examples are bad because salient old information should not be stressed . the ( c ) examples are acceptable , because sentence stress does n't fall on the old information , but are less good than the ( a ) examples , because the stress has been shifted away from the right edge of the sentence . in the article i provide a technical formal account of this fact . the same kind of account might extend to the pronouns and modified particles , but some more work is needed , since examples with particle before pronoun or modified particle after np are worse than the ( c ) examples above , even with stress shift to the left . however , the fact that stress on a pronoun ( or coordination of pronouns , which also makes them phonologically heavy ) allow it to follow the particle suggests a prosodic account . i realize this has been rather breezy , but it 's because i do n't know how much of it really is of interest to you . if you me to expand on something , just ask . if you want more complete references , or if you would like me to send any of my own papers , i 'd be happy to oblige . best , peter svenonius - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - again , thanks very much to all of you stefan th . gries "	0

Subject: new books : morphology  new from holland academic graphics : syntactic and lexical deverbal morphology in dutch by frans van der putten abstract : _ matter and mind in morphology _ investigates the nature and place of morphology . the underlying assumption is that morphology can be both lexical and syntactic , and that the distinctive properties of the two types of morphology follow from the nature of the lexicon and the syntax respectively . the human language system is argued to consist of a matter - domain and a mind - domain . the matter - domain comprises the syntax as well as the lf and pf modules . its properties ( governing principles , vocabulary , type of categorization ) are those commonly assumed in generative linguistics , and operations taking place in this domain are unconscious and fast . the mind - domain , on the other hand , is a conceptual module where language utterances are matched with a speaker 's knowledge of the world . it makes use of semantic notions ( thematic roles , features like [ + / - human ] or [ + / - animate ] and aspectual notions ) and prototype categorization . processes in this domain are slower and semi-conscious . the lexicon is the interface between the two domains , its main function being the translation of information from one domain into the format of the other . this language model is the basis on which distinctive properties of syntactic and lexical morphology are formulated . in the remaining part of the dissertation , these distinctive properties are used to identify a variety of morphological processes in dutch as either 's yntactic ' , ' lexical ' or ' mixed ' . since the distinction between lexical and syntactic morphology is primarily relevant in the case of word formation based on verbs , the discussion focuses on deverbal processes deriving nouns , adjectives and verbs . the book is aimed at linguists interested in the place and nature of morphology in general and at those investigating dutch deverbal morphology . paperback , xiii + 379 pp .

"Subject: disc : functionalism 8 . 798  this is in response to benji wald 's comments on ( 8 . 736 , disc ) functionalism : i fear that we may be talking a little at cross-purposes here . my main interest is in clarifying the position of natural phonology on the issue of so-called contradictory processes . benji seems a little more focused on the question of what it means to call something a "" cluster "" in phonetic terms . < deleted : elaboration on the nature of phonetic clusters , particularly [ pt ] > > > the question , if i remember correctly , > > was why speakers should be able to pronounce the reduced [ pt ] > > if they could n't pronounce the unreduced one . > > in view of what i have said above , i understand that the phonological > processes involved are not consciously controllable , and that reduction ( or > whatever ? ) of the first vowel in "" potato "" reflects a process which normally > occurs when speech is not deliberate or conscious , but when it is > relatively spontaneous . so we ' re dealing with unconscious stylistic > effects , in my view . i can agree with you here . this is yet another reason for believing that the fast speech reduction of [ p @ t ] to [ pt ] ( or whatever ) poses no problem at all for natural phonological theory . the fortition that breaks up a controlled attempt to pronounce initial [ pt ] would not necessarily have to apply to what is loosely described as "" [ pt ] "" ( i . e . reduced [ p @ t ] ) in fast speech . > > > > the fact that you can't pronounce the cluster in no way means that the > > > > cluster is banned as a side-effect in the pronunciation of some other > > > > phonetic target . > > that just goes along with what i just said , but sounds absurd because it > does not explicitly acknowledge the difference between consciously > controllable phonological processes , and unconscious , spontaneous , but > nevertheless learned / acquired , processes . am i missing that somehow the > theory at issue does indeed account for this distinction ? does it even > recognise it ? or , should it ? yes on all counts . thank you for clarifying that . natural phonology is a theory about pronounceability . that was part of baudouin 's original vision when he founded modern phonological theory . it is no longer necessarily part of the modern vision of what phonology is about . basically , baudouin observed that phonetic alternations all fell into just two types - - those that involved phonetic variants of a single "" phoneme "" and those that involved two distinct phonemes . as stampe has pointed out many times , the latter are consciously manipulable . the former are quite unconscious and difficult to control . by the way , it is interesting that later generations seem to have lost their way , thanks due in no small part to baudouin 's influential student shcherba . it was shcherba who seemed to have influenced the concept of the phoneme among british ( thence american ) linguists . shcherba limited the phoneme to be just a perceptual unit , which radically changed linguistic analyses of what was includable or excludable from the study of phonology ( i . e . phonemics at the time ) . trubetzkoy retained baudouin 's essential vision of the boundaries of phonology , but he preferred a more "" scherbemic "" conception of the phoneme . so he had to have "" archiphonemes "" in his phonology , which he still considered a separate branch of linguistic theory from morphophonology . sapir , who carried on a close correspondence with trubetzkoy , also retained this sharp distinction between phonology ( i . e . stampean processes ) and morphophonology ( i . e . stampean rules ) . what ties all of these approaches together is that pronounceability is fundamental to the concept of phonological theory ( although trubetzkoy might not have explicitly agreed with this claim ) . > ( self - conscious speech is indeed the suppression of some phonetic > realisation rules , but depending on how deep your phonology - - > morphophonemics ? - - is , it is never the elimination of everything short of > "" deep "" phonotactics , right ? in fact , i ask : is self-conscious speech ever > anything but the suppression of some realisation rules , i . e . , does it ever > * really * include the addition of a rule ? that might be an interesting > question for some theorists . ) there are some hidden assumptions in the above that make it difficult to comment on , so i ' ll just tackle the one red flag that you raised for me . a theory of phonology need not have any phonotactics , deep or otherwise . since generative theory is about well-formedness , it must address such phenomena as part of the theory . however , natural phonology just sees banned sequences of sounds as those which cannot be directly ( or intentionally ) pronounced during normal speech . unpronounceability need not necessarily be attributable to a single cause . since you do n't need to pronounce nonexistent phonetic structures , you do n't need to suppress any processes that affect them . hence , there can be multiple processes banning so-called phonotactically impermissible sequences . hence , no need for a single generalization in your theory to ban such sequences . < . . . > > > stampean theory predicts > > that very early language learners will have both devoicing of > > vowels between voiceless consonants and voicing of consonants between > > vowels .

"Subject: new books in psycholinguistics & neurolinguistics  the ascent of babel : an exploration of language , mind , and understanding gerry t . m . altmann , university of york "" altmann has written a cross between a textbook for beginning psycholinguistic students and a popular science book for laypersons . . . . altmann explains in lay terms what psycholinguistics is and how its findings affect what we know of human experience . "" - - booklist language is one of the faculties that sets humans apart from animals , the crucial thing which makes our complex social interactions possible . it is a faculty which demands fantastically intricate mental and physical coordination , yet babies possess a remarkable ability to learn its complexities from a very early age . the ascent of babel explores the ways in which the mind produces and understands language : the ways in which the sounds of language evoke meaning , and the ways in which the desire to communicate causes us to produce those sounds to begin with . the "" ascent "" symbolises different things : the progression from sound to meaning , the ascent that we each undergo , from birth onwards , as we learn our mother tongue , and the quest to understand the mental processes which underlie our use of language . gerry altmann leads the reader on this ascent , which comprises a fascinating tour : from how babies learn language and how we discriminate between different sounds , through comprehension of the sounds and structures of language ( and the pitfalls along the way ) , to the production of spoken and written language , the effects of brain damage on language , and finally the ways in which computer simulations of interconnecting nerve cells can learn language . it is a journey of discovery , written in an engaging and witty style , at the end of which it becomes clear that babel 's summit - the secret of language - may actually lie at its foundations , where babies play and language is learned . december 1997 272 pp . ; 46 linecuts 0-19 - 852378 - 5 $ 27 . 50 oxford university press cognitive foundations of grammar bernd heine , university of cologne , germany the main function of language is to convey meaning . therefore , argues bernd heine in these pages , the question of why language is structured the way it is must first of all be answered with reference to this function . linguistic explanations offered in terms of other exponents of language structure ( for example , syntax ) are likely to highlight peripheral or epi-phenomenal - - rather than central - - characteristics of language structure . heine provides a solid introductory treatment of the ways in which language structure ( that is , grammar ) and language usage can be explained with reference to the processes underlying human conceptualization and communication . exploring an area of linguistics that has developed only recently and is rapidly expanding , cognitive foundations of grammar will appeal to students of linguistics , psychology , and anthropology , especially those interested in grammaticalization processess . november 1997 200 pp . ; 11 linecuts 0-19 - 510252 - 5 paper $ 19 . 95 0-19 - 510251 - 7 cloth $ 45 . 00 oxford university press narrative comprehension : a discourse perspective catherine emmott , university of glasgow there has so far been relatively little research by cognitive linguists on the comprehension of narrative texts . this book draws on insights from discourse analysis and artificial intelligence to explore how readers construct and maintain mental representations of fictional characters and contexts , and goes on to consider the implications of cognitive modelling for grammatical theory and a literary-linguistic model of narrative text-types . june 1997 336 pp . ; 5 text-figures 0-19 - 823649 - 2 $ 80 . 00 oxford university press the inheritance and innateness of grammars edited by myrna gopnik , mcgill university , canada ( vancouver studies in cognitive science 6 ) is language somehow innate in the structure of the human brain , or is it completely learned ? this debate is still at the heart of linguistics , especially as it intersects with psychology and cognitive science . in collecting papers which discuss the evidence and arguments regarding this difficult question , the inheritance and innateness of grammars considers cases ranging from infants who are just beginning to learn the properties of a native language to language-impaired adults who will never learn one . these studies show that , while precursors of language exist in other creatures , the abilities necessary for constructing full-fledged grammars are part of the biological endowment of human beings . the essays that comprise this volume test the range and specificity of that endowment , while also contributing to our understanding of the intricate and complex relationship between language and biology . june 1997 240 pp . ; 44 linecuts 0-19 - 511534 - 1 paper $ 29 . 95 0-19 - 511533 - 3 cloth $ 60 . 00 oxford university press for more information about linguistics titles from oxford university press : e-mail : linguistics @ oup-usa . org or visit the oxford university press usa web site : http : / / www . oup-usa . org oxford university press usa "	0

"Subject: shor  the revival of the shor literaly language . irina nevskaya , mainz . summary the article is devoted to the present-day sociolinguistic situation in mountain shoriya ( russia , the south of western siberia , the kemerovo region ) . the indigenous population of mountain shoriya are the shors who speak one of the siberian turkic languages . the shor language has survived in spite of unfavourable circumstances . until very recently , it was neither written nor taught at school for half a century . at present , the shors try to restore social functions to the language . the turcological traditions at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute have facilitated ( and even instigated ) the revival of the shor literary language . the article touches upon the history of literary shor and of shor language research in novokuznetsk , and analyzes recent developments in shoriya : the revival of shor language school teaching , and of written shor . special attention is paid to problems facing shor turcologists who were providing the revival process with scientific back-up . the article will be fully published in one of the next issues of the journal turkic languages here we present some extracts of it . general information the shors are one of the minor indigenous turkic peoples of siberia . in the former ussr there were slightly over 16 , 000 shors . 12 , 585 of them , according to the census of 1989 , lived in kuzbass ( the kemerovo region ) , in the south of western siberia [ itogi 1989 , 42 ] . . . the shors inhabit mountain shoriya , the northern part of the sayan - altay mountain region . the ethnonym was introduced by the academician v . v . radlov at the end of the nineteenth century . the ethnonym , which came to be used officially , was originally the name of one of the turkic family clans or tribes ( sooks ) who spoke rather similar turkic dialects . the turks of altay also used the terrn ' shor ' for the turkic - speaking population of the kondoma ( shor lfondumj , mrassu ( shor pras ) and tom ( shor tom ) river basins . at that time , this population did not have a general native name . as the official and native name oftthis ethnos , the ethnonym spread in the mid - 1 ^ 30 's , during the beginning of the national cansolidation of the turkic sayan - altay ethnic groups . the ethnic group formed from various turkic and non - turkic sources . the ethnonym ' aba ' , the name of one of tolax sooks , is encountered in chinese sources dating from 603 [ pritsak 1959 , 630 ] . the shors are considered to be turkicized ob - ugrians : linguistic , ethnographic and anthropological research shows thz presence of an ob - ugric substratum in the ethnos : in the toponymy of shoriya there are a lot of ket names ( e . g . the river names ending in * zas / + sas ) , indicating that the region was inhabited earlier by the kets . many questions of shor ethnic history have not yet been solved . as a separate nation with selfidentification and national sentiment , it formed within the turkic - speaking population of this region during the last three centuries . the shor ethnologist dr . valery kimeev delineates 3 periods of the ethnos history [ kimeev 1994 , 4 - 6 ] . 1 . the formation of territorial ethnic groups of the shors within the administrative ethnic territory ( russian kuzneckij uezd ) , from the beginning of the seventeenth until the beginning of the twentieth century . 2 . national and cultural consolidation in the framework of the autonomous national district ( cor / lo-swo / skij nacional ' nyj / ajon ) , 1926 - 1939 . at that time , the processes of national development were very intensive . the most important contributing factors were the development of the literary language , school instruction in shor and the spreading of literacy among the shor population . 3 . from the early 1940 's until very recently , the shor nation in the conditions of active spreading of the dominant russian culture . within these years the shors lost their literary language and were at the brink of full assimilation . socio - linguistic situation in shordya in the late 1980 's the shor language has survived despite unfavourable circumstances . the fast industrial development of the area in the twentieth century almost destroyed the traditional shor way of life and had a profound influence on the area . the mass inflow of mainly russian speaking migrants initiated assimilation processes which threatened not only the shor language but also the very existence of the shor nation . beginning in the 1950 's , the following new economic and social factors emerged : small farms were merged , and many shor villages disappeared ; people , in search of work , had to move to cities ( where the processes of assimilation moved even faster ) ; the rural population was reduced , the urban population in mountainshoriya grew ; schools in small shor villages were closed ; shor boarding schools were opened ( these were primary and secondary educational establishments in big villages and industrial centers where shor children lived apart from their families during the academic year and were instructed in russian ) . as a result , by the end of the 1980 's , shor came to have a lower social status it was not a written language , nor a language of school education . furthermore , its transmission to younger generations had almost stopped , and the number of speakers had dramatically diminished . the language competence of speakers was reduced , especially of urban shors ( only 3 % of urban shors could speak shor fluently in 1986 versus 20 . 1 % in 1976 ) , while their competence in russian increased . in 1989 only 59 . 4 % of the shors considered shor to be their mother tongue , versus 76 . 6 % in 1970 . the number of shors who considered russian to be their mother tongue increased from 24 . 4 % up to 39 . 1 % [ itogi , 1989 , 42 ] . we see that people preferred to give up their mother tongue . the history of the shor literary language is important for the analysis of the factors which led to this situation . general information on the history of the shor litera / y language shor could be called one of the "" oppressed languages "" of the former ussr . within the twentieth century alone , the shor language lost its literary tradition twice . the first time was just after the october revolution in russia , when the church schools founded by the altay missionaries were closed . the altay missionaries preached in the native languages of siberia 's aborigines . they published books in indigenous languages of the siberian people , founded primary , secondary schools , and religious tertiary schools where they trained national priests and teachers for shor schools . one of the first primary schools in shoriya was opened in the village of kuzedeevo by the wellknown missionary and linguist v . 1 . verbitsky who taught at this school . by the time of the october revolution there were schools in all the larger villages . in the northern part of shoriya , about 40 % of the population was literate . shor was the language of school teaching , written communication , literature . the shor literature of the time was sparse ; there were only shor translations of religious literature , and original works . after 1917 , with the outbreak of the revolution and civil war , all schools were closed , and hence the literary tradition was interrupted . in 1927 the shor national district was formed . though the district did not exist long ( it was annulled in 1939 ) , this was an important period for the development of the shortliterary language . it was taught at schools ; a considerable number of books in shor were published ( more th , an 150 titles ) and the language , folklore and ethnology of the shors were studied intensively . however , the tragic events of 1937-45 had a devastating effect on the culture of the shors . in 1942 , the last issue of the shor language newspaper "" kyzl sor "" ( ' red shoriya ' ) was published , and all the shor schools closed . frqm this time on , the shor language was no longer written or taught at schools for half a century . the sphere of its functioning was minimal : it was only used at home for everyday topics . all other cultural needs were met by russian , which was the language of education , of literary works , of the mass media , as well as of administrative , political , and economic relations . during this period , several generations of urban shors grew up with at best minimal competence in shor . at present , history gives the shor language a chance ( probably the last one ) to become a literary language . the active growth of shor national sentiment and political activity , their interest in the national culture and language , and changes in the country as a whole can contribute to this . the revival of literary shor began with the publishing of textbooks of shor , the training of shor language teachers , and the teaching of shor at schools and in shor language circles . the revival of teaching shor at schools in 1988 , a chair of the shor language and literature was created at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute ( ngpi ) . the first head was prof . andrey chudoyakov . the same year a shor department was established in the faculty of philology and teacher training in shor language and literature began . a year later , teachers of different subjects who were shors themselves began to teach shor in a number of schools . they were graduates of a 2 - year course of training leaders for shor language circles . the course was organized in novokuznetsk by dr . alisa esipova . the shor alphabet book and textbooks for the primary years were written by dr . nadezhda kurpeshko ( kemerovo ) and members of the department . in 1994 , the first graduates of the national department ( 5 people ) began to work at schools in the kemerovo region . at present , about 20 teachers of shor work at schools in the tashtagol and mezhdurechensk districts of mountain shoriya , both in cities and villages . some schools which were closed 10-30 years ago resumed teaching . some schools were rebuilt . turcology in novokuznetsk the revival process was facilitated ( or , perhaps , even instigated ) by turcological traditions at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute . during the 50 crucial years of shor language history , the collecting , compiling and describing of all still available material has not stopped . the shor language research has been carried out mainly by university foreign-language teachers at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute . when in late eighties we witnessed the uprise of shor national sentiment and the desire to restore social functions to the language , there had already been qualified people ( among them also shors ) who could cope with this task . initially , the most important task facing such linguists was to provide the revival process with scientific back-up : to create a modern orthography for shor , to choose a standard dialect , and to work out literary norms . references itogi vsesojuznoj perepisi naselenija 1989 goda . vypusk 4 . nacional ' nyj sostav . 1990 . kemerovo : kemerovskoe kniznoe izdatel 's tvo . patruseva , g . m . 1994 . sovremennye etniceskie processy u sorcev . in : kimeev , v . m . & lavrent ' eva , l . a . & tokmasev , j . k . & sogrina , n . a . & bobrov , v . v . & nevskaja , i . a . & tivjakov , s . d .

"" making sense "" sounds reassuringly uncontroversial , and it has taken the insights of jerome bruner in the 1960s , and of michael halliday and his associates in recent years , to bring out the richness of meaning that this expression can carry . it is now widely accepted that sense is not simply "" there "" in the world , waiting to be discovered and documented , but that it is actually created by human beings in societies . the idea that "" reality "" is "" created "" in language also implies that there must be more than one reality , and that a number of realities can be articulated and compared . these possibilities carry major implications for language education , social identity and participation - - - or , less reassuringly , for educational and social exclusion . the thematic emphasis of this conference on "" creating sense "" , then , includes the essential notions that any single form of sense can also be questioned and "" unmade "" , and that alternative kinds of sense can be remade or "" re-created "" through texts . making , unmaking and remaking meanings are fundamental aspects of social and educational experience , from infancy through primary and secondary school years and beyond , continuing into adulthood and maturity . much education has to do with learning to think , talk and write about things in ways that differ from the initial "" commonsense "" knowledge or belief that children have already acquired in their communities . to bring this about without undermining what is valid and valued in children 's lives is an enormously challenging and problematic social and cultural activity . that it is also a necessary one can be argued both in terms of mainstream rationality ( the development of scientific thinking being a prime example here ) and of critical awareness , which includes learning to deconstruct powerful people 's accounts of how the world is and ought to be , and to propose alternative accounts . full participation in social and political life is only possible when people have learned , as ronald carter has put it , how to "" see through language "" . these concerns over creating , questioning and re-creating sense are explored in this conference in relation to two domains , those of language education and media studies . in the context of formal education , learners have both to discern meaning in what is offered to them and actively to make "" their own "" meanings as they interpret and analyse experience from a variety of perspectives which may be proposed to them or discovered by them . all this raises important issues of participation and exclusion relating to learners ' personal and social explorations of language , and the ways in which these two modes of exploration may be related . the conference will pursue these concerns in the broad context of language education as its first domain . the second conference domain is that of media studies , with particular attention to media discourse and reality construction . the conference seeks to bring to light some of the ways in which realities , like stories , are invented , told , represented and mediated through available technologies . diverse experiences and accounts of reality are constructed through the interplay of language and image . these can , for instance , be presented as fantasies , fictional explorations of experience , docu-dramas or documentary coverage of events , among other things . the impact of such accounts on audiences and "" the public "" depends on many social , cultural and educational factors , but the need for modern citizens to be able to make their own sense of accounts that are offered to them , and also to offer accounts of their own , increasingly appears fundamental to effective social participation as well as to social critique . the conference looks to stimulate debate that is grounded in - - - or informedly set against - - - current theories , practices and findings of teaching and research communities in language and communication studies . another main aim is to suggest guidelines for informed , responsible and reflective practice in the domains of language education and mediaoa studies . a theme of particular interest , to be developed especially in workshop mode , is that of materials writing for educational purposes in both conference domains .

"Subject: cfp : language resources for european minority languages  workshop on language resources for european minority languages - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - granada , spain - may 27 1998 ( morning ) call for papers this workshop will be held in conjunction with the international conference on language resources and evaluation ( lrec ) , granada , spain : may 28-30 , 1998 . the workshop will provide a forum for researchers working on the development of speech and language resources for the indigenous minority languages of europe . workshop scope and aims - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the minority or "" lesser used "" languages of europe ( e . g . basque , welsh , breton ) are under increasing pressure from the major languages . some of them ( e . g . gaelic ) are becoming endangered , but others ( e . g . catalan ) are in a stronger position , with a certain amount of official recognition and funding . however , the situation with regard to language resources is fragmented and disorganised . some minority languages have been adequately researched linguistically , but most have not , and the vast majority do not yet possess basic speech and language resources ( such as text and speech corpora ) which are sufficient to permit commercial development of products . if this situation were to continue , the minority languages of europe would fall a long way behind the major languages , as regards the availability of commercial speech and language products . this in turn will accelerate the decline of those languages that are already struggling to survive , as speakers are forced to use the majority language for interaction with these products . to break this vicious circle , it is important to encourage the development of basic language resources . the workshop is a very small first step towards encouraging the development of such resources . the aim is to share information , so that isolated researchers will not need to start from nothing . an important aspect will be the forming of personal contacts , which at present do not exist . the aim is to make it easier for isolated researchers with little funding and no existing corpora to begin developing a usuable speech or text database . there will be a balance between presentations of existing language resources , and more general presentations designed to give background information . technical areas covered will include : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - presentation of existing speech and text databases for minority languages , with particular emphasis on their design and their annotation . presentation of existing lexicons for minority languages , with particular emphasis on fast production methods . encouragement of standardisation , using the recommendations formulated by the eagles working groups . presentation of the eu 's policy towards minority languages , and the situation of minority languages in europe . papers are invited that will describe existing speech and language resources for minority languages ( speech databases , text databases , and lexicons ) , also papers based on the analysis of these resources . presentations will last 20 minutes each . all presentations will be given in english , since it cannot be assumed that each listener will speak all the minority languages discussed . organizers : briony williams university of edinburgh , scotland , uk climent nadeu universitat politecnica de catalunya , catalunya , spain alex monaghan dublin city university , ireland paper submission -

"Subject: review of boguraev and pustejovsky  branimir boguraev and james pustejovsky . 1996 . corpus processing for lexical acquisition . mit press : cambridge , massachusetts . 245 pages . $ 32 . 50 . the term "" acquisition "" in the title of this book refers to automatic learning - - - acquisition not by human children , but by natural language systems . the papers in this book deal with the topic of building and refining lexica for natural language systems automatically - - i . e . by computer , with little or no human intervention - - from large corpora . building lexica for natural language systems by hand is difficult , expensive , and labor-intensive , and the result may be out of date before it is completed . furthermore , by the standards of earlier systems , lexica have become enormous . continuous speech dictation systems ship with active vocabularies in the range of 30 , 000 lexical items . lexica in production by one company are expected to have 200 , 000 entries for american english and 700 , 000 entries for german . so , from an industrial point of view , work on the automatic acquisition of lexical knowledge is very welcome . this is not to say that automatic lexical acquisition should be of interest only to applied linguists . lexical information is also necessary in psycholinguistic research , and some of the work in this volume shows such application . furthermore , the sorts of data that researchers in this field are attempting to acquire is just the sort of data that is needed for large-scale applications of formalisms like head - driven phrase structure grammar . so , the work described in this book should be of interest to academic , as well as industrial , linguists . this book is the result of a workshop , and as such , it has the usual scattering of topics seen in proceedings . this should be seen as a feature , not a bug : the result is that there is something here for everyone . various papers come from the fields of corpus linguistics , statistical analysis of language , psycholinguistics , rule acquisition , semantics , and lexical acquisition . the papers are divided into five broad categories : ( 1 ) unknown words , ( 2 ) building representations , ( 3 ) categorization , ( 4 ) lexical semantics , and ( 5 ) evaluation . in addition , a paper by the editors lays out the reasons for , and challenges of , automatic acquisition of lexical information . ( 1 ) introduction issues in text-based lexicon acquisition , branimir boguraev and james pustejovsky . this paper presents an in-depth answer to the question with which lexicon builders are perenially plagued by anyone to whom they try to explain their work : why not just use an on-line dictionary ? the short answer is that such dictionaries are static and do not evolve at the same pace as the language that they are attempting to describe . the long answer is that natural language systems require information that is not reflected in traditional dictionaries-semantic feature geometries , subcategorization frames , and so on . so : "" the fundamental problem of lexical acquisition . . . is how to provide , fully and adequately , the systems with the lexical knowledge they need to operate with the proper degree of efficiency . the answer . . . to which the community is converging today . . . is to extract the lexicon from the texts themselves "" ( 3 ) . automatic lexical acquisition can trivially solve the short-answer problem by allowing updating as frequently as new data can be acquired . more importantly , it allows the linguist to define the questions that they would like the lexicon to answer , rather than having those questions chosen for them by the dictionary maker . ( 2 ) dealing with unknown words consider a spell-checking program that encounters the ( unknown ) word "" horowitz . "" the spell checker would like to know the best action to take with this word : is it a mis-spelling that should be replaced with something else , or is it a precious datum that should be added to its lexicon ? the spell-checker asks its user ; the papers in this section discuss attempts to answer these questions automatically . linguists tend not to pay much attention to proper nouns . as mcdonald puts it in an epigram to his paper in this volume , "" proper names are the rodney dangerfield of linguistics . they do n't get no respect "" ( 21 ) . thus , it might surprise the reader to find that all three of the papers in this section deal with names . the identification and classification of names is , in fact , of considerable interest in natural language systems . for relatively uninflected languages like english , names may constitute the majority of unknown words encountered in a corpus . names raise special issues for classification , including the facts that they may have multiple forms ; multiple forms may have the same referent in a single text , raising problems for reference and coindexation ; and , on a less theoretically interesting but no less morally and legally compelling level , they may require special treatment in the corpus . for instance , proper names are routinely removed from medical data , and may need to be removed from sociolinguistic data , as well . internal and external evidence in the identification and semantic categorization of proper names . david d . mcdonald . this paper is written in the language of artificial intelligence . it describes the proper name facility of the sparser system . it describes the use of context-sensitive rewrite rules to analyze "" external evidence "" for proper names , e . g . their combinatorial properties . a surprising and impressive aspect of the system described here is that it does not use stored lists of proper nouns . identifying unknown proper names in newswire text . inderjeet mani , t . richard macmillan . this paper describes a method of using contextual clues such as appositives ( "" < name > , the daughter of a prominent local physician "" or "" a niloticist of great repute , < name > "" ) and felicity conditions for identifying names . the contextual clues themselves are then tapped for data about the referents of the names . categorizing and standardizing proper nouns for efficient information retrieval . woojin paik , elizabeth d . liddy , edmund yu , and mary mckenna . this paper deals with discovering and encoding relationships between groups and their members . paik et al . state the problem as follows : "" proper nouns are . . . important sources of information for detecting relevant document in information retrieval . . . . group proper nouns ( e . g . , "" middle east "" ) and group common nouns ( e . g . , "" third world "" ) will not match on their constituents unless the group entity is mentioned in the document "" ( 61 ) . the problem , then , is to allow a search on "" health care third world "" to find a document on "" health care in nicaragua . "" the paper includes a short but useful discussion of the problems that can arise with respect to prepositions when noun phrases containing proper nouns are parsed as common noun phrases . ( the authors solved this problem by changing the ordering of two bracketing routines . ) ( 3 ) building representations customizing a lexicon to better suit a computational task . marti a . hearst , hinrich schuetze . as mentioned above , lexicon building is expensive ; this paper describes a method for reducing development costs by customizing a pre-existing lexicon , rather than building a new one . the project described here uses as its pre-existing lexicon wordnet , an on-line lexicon that contains information about semantic relationships such as hypernymy , hyponymy , etc . this was customized by reducing the resolution of the semantic hierarchies to simple categories , and by combining categories from "" distant parts of the hierarchy . . . . . we are interested in finding grouping of terms that contribute to a frame or schema-like representation . . . this can be achieved by finding associational lexical relations among the existing taxonymic relations "" ( 79 ) . crucially , these relations should be derived from a particular corpus . the paper includes a nice description of the algorithm used for collapsing semantic categories . towards building contextual representations of word senses using statistical models . claudia leacock , geoffrey towell , and ellen m . voorhees . this paper describes a method for differentiating amongst the multiple senses of a polysemous word . the authors discuss using "" topical context , "" or content words occurring in the vicinity , and "" local context , "" which includes not just content words but function morphemes , word order , and syntactic structure . they test three methods of acquiring topical context : bayesian , context vector , and a neural network . they also give the results of a psycholinguistic experiment comparing human performance with machine performance , given the topical contexts created by the three types of "" classifiers . "" local context acquisition is based on acquiring "" templates , "" or specific sequences of words . this paper gives a particularly nice description of its algorithms , and is so clearly written as to be suitable for presentation in courses on statistics or psycholinguistics . ( 4 ) categorization a context driven conceptual clustering method for verb classification . roberto basili , maria - teresa pazienza , paola velardi . this paper describes a method of categorizing verbs with respect to thematic roles , drawing on the cobweb and ariosto _ lex systems . its aim is to do categorization without relying on "" defining features , "" and to categorize with respect to the domain of discourse . the authors describe their algorithms , and the paper has a nice literature review , covering both psycholinguistic and computational perspectives on classification . distinguished usage . scott a . waterman . this paper tackles the syntax / semantics interface . the author attempts to give a linguistic grounding to systems that map text to some knowledge base by means of pattern matching : "" by relating lexical pattern-based approaches to a lexical semantic framework , such as the generative lexicon theory [ pustejovsky , 1991 ] , my aim is to provide a basis through which pattern-based understanding systems can be understood in more conventional linguistic terms . . . . . my main contention is that such a framework can be developed by viewing the lexical patterns as structural mappings from text to denotation in a compositional lexical semantics . . . obviating the need for separate syntactic and semantic analysis "" ( 144 ) . this paper features an excellent presentation of background ideas and explication of the issues that it discusses . ( 5 ) lexical semantics detecting dependencies between semantic verb subclasses and subcategorization frames in text corpora . victor poznanski , antonio sanfilippo . this paper describes "" a suite of programs . . . . which elicit dependencies between semantic verb classes and their . . . subcategorization frames using machine readable thesauri to assist in semantic tagging of texts "" ( 176 ) . the system uses a commercially available thesaurus-like online lexicon to do semantic tagging . a "" subcategorization frame "" is then automatically extracted , and the subcategorization frames are analyzed and classified . acquiring predicate-argument mapping information from multilingual texts . chinatsu aone , douglas mckee . the authors hold predicate-argument mapping to be equivalent to conceptual representation ; as such , it is clearly important to language understanding . this is the only paper in the volume that deals with bilingual corpora . ( 6 ) evaluating acquisition evaluation techniques for automatic semantic extraction : comparing syntactic and window based approaches . gregory grefenstette . this paper proposes techniques for comparing "" knowledge-poor "" approaches to determining the degree of semantic similarity between two words . a syntax-based method is compared to a windowing technique . the syntax-based method is shown to perform better for high-frequency words , while the windowing method is the better performer for low-frequency words . conclusion this is by no means an introductory text on automatic lexical acquisition . nonetheless , this volume contains papers that will appeal to workers in a variety of linguistic disciplines . the reviewer k . bretonnel cohen is a linguist at voice input technologies in dublin , ohio , where his responsibilities include the construction of tools for lexicon building and analysis .

Subject: phonology  new from holland academic graphics : the iambic issue : iambs as a result of constraint interaction by ruben van de vijver abstract : _ the iambic issue _ deals with a specific problem in metrical theory . iambic feet have some properties that set them apart from trochaic feet : in iambic languages , stress on both the first and on the last syllable is avoided ; iambs are not assigned from right to left ; the proto typical iambic foot ( a light syllable followed by a heavy syllable ) does not play a role in prosodic morphology . building on optimality theory , it is argued that iambic feet are the result of constraint interaction rather than being building blocks of metrical theory . in chapter 2 and 3 , the stress patterns of several carib and yupik languages are analyzed in considerable detail and it is shown that the rightheaded feet found on the surface in these languages are the result of the interaction between a constraint which favors leftheaded feet and a constraint which bars both the initial and the final syllable from being stressed . the claim that iambs can only arise at the left edge of the word , and not on the right edge of the word , is substantiated in chapter 4 . in this chapter the stress patterns of several languages , which are claimed to have iambs arising at the right edge of the word , are analyzed . an analysis of these languages in terms of leftheaded feet is feasible as well , and , in many cases , is even preferable . the prosodic morphology of a number of languages is then investigated in chapter 5 . it is concluded that the prototypical iamb is never used as a building block in prosodic morphology . finally , a summary is presented in chapter 6 . addressing issues in metrical phonology , this book is of interest for phonologists as well as researchers interested in prosodic morphology . paperback , xii + 271 pp .

Subject: acl / coling workshop on translingual information management  ! ! ! ! submission deadline march 23 ! ! ! ! coling-acl998 workshop on translingual information management current levels and future abilities august 16 , 1998 ( following acl / coling-98 ) university of montreal , montreal ( quebec , canada ) call for papers description - - - - - - - - - - the development of natural language applications which handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information is the next major challenge facing the field of computational linguistics . over the past 50 years , a variety of language-related capabilities has been developed in areas such as machine translation , information retrieval , and speech recognition , together with core capabilities such as information extraction , summarization , parsing , generation , multimedia planning and integration , statistics-based methods , ontologies , lexicon construction and lexical representations , and grammar . the next few years will require the extension of these technologies to encompass multi-lingual and multi-modal information . extending current technologies will require integration of the various capabilities into multi-functional natural language systems . however , there is today no clear vision of how these technologies could or should be assembled into a coherent framework . what would be involved in connecting a speech recognition system to an information retrieval engine , and then using machine translation and summarization software to process the retrieved text ? how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? this workshop is a follow-on to an nsf - sponsored workshop held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation in granada , spain ( may 1998 ) , at which an international panel of invited experts will consider these questions in an attempt to identify the most effective future directions of computational linguistics research - - especially in the context of the need to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information . the follow-on acl workshop is intended to open the discussion to the computational inguistics community as a whole . the workshop will include ample time for discussion . a report summarizing the discussions at granada will be available before the acl workshop . topics - - - - - the workshop will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas : o multi-lingual resources ( lexicons , ontologies , corpora , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation o automated ( cross-lingual ) summarization and information extraction o multimedia communication , in conjunction with text o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o methods and techniques ( both statistics-based and linguistics - based ) of pre-parsing , parsing , generation , information acquisition , etc . we invite submissions which report on work in these areas . all papers should clearly identify how the work addresses the issues and questions outlined above . submissions - - - - - - - - - - only hard-copy submissions will be accepted . authors should submit six ( 6 ) copies of the full-length paper ( 3500-5000 words ) . submissions should be sent to : nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , new york 12604-0520 usa style files and templates for preparing submissions can be found at http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / styles . html the official language of the conference is english . important deadlines - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - submission deadline : march 23 , 1998 notification date : may 15 , 1998 camera ready copy due : june 15 , 1998 scientific committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - charles fillmore university of california berkeley , usa robert frederking carnegie mellon university , usa ulrich heid university of stuttgart , germany eduard hovy information sciences institute , usa nancy ide vassar college , usa lauri karttunen ( tentative ) rank xerox research , france kimmo koskenniemi university of helsinki , finland mun kew leong national university of singapore joseph mariani limsi / cnrs , france mark maybury the mitre corporation , usa sergei nirenburg new mexico state university , usa akitoshi okumura nec , japan martha palmer university of pennsylvania , usa james pustejovsky brandeis university , usa peter schaueble eth , switzerland oliviero stock irst , italy felisa verdejo uned , spain piek vossen university of amsterdam , netherlands wolfgang wahlster dfki , germany organizers - - - - - - - - - robert frederking , carnegie mellon university , usa eduard hovy , isi , university of southern california , usa nancy ide , vassar college , usa information - - - - - - - - - - information on the workshop can be found at http : / / www . cs . vassar . edu / ~ ide / translingual . html inquiries may be addressed to the organizers : robert frederking < ref @ nl . cs . cmu . edu > eduard hovy < hovy @ isi . edu > nancy ide < ide @ cs . vassar . edu > 	0

"Subject: new books in syntax & morphology ( 3 titles )  negation and clausal structure : a comparative study of romance languages raffaella zanuttini , georgetown university ( oxford studies in comparative syntax ) "" zanuttini is absolutely at the cutting edge of research both in romance languages and in theoretical syntax . . . . a significant contribution to the field . "" - - donna jo napoli , swarthmore college every human language has some syntactic means of distinguishing a negative from a non-negative sentence ; in other words , every speaker 's syntactic competence provides a means to express sentential negation . this ability , however , may be expressed in different ways , as shown by the fact that individual languages employ different syntactic strategies for the expression of the same semantic function of negating a sentence . zanuttini 's goal here is to characterize the range of such variation by comparing the different syntactic means for expressing sentential negation exhibited by the members of one language family - - the romance languages - - and by reducing the differences we witness to a constrained set of choices available to the particular grammars of these languages . this sort of analysis is a first step towards the ultimate goal of determining and understanding what limits there are on the syntactic options that universal grammar imposes on the expression of sentential negation . september 1997 216 pp . ; 18 charts 0-19 - 508055 - 6 paper $ 39 . 95 oxford university press clause structure and word order in hebrew and arabic : an essay in comparative semitic syntax ur shlonsky , university of geneva ( oxford studies in comparative syntax ) shlonsky uses chomsky 's government and binding approach to examine clausal architecture and verb movement in hebrew and several varieties of arabic . he establishes a syntactic analysis of hebrew and then extends that analysis to certain aspects of arabic clausal syntax . through this comparative lens of hebrew , shlonsky hopes to resolve a number of problems in arabic syntax . his results generate some novel and important conclusions concerning the patterns of negations , verb movement , the nature of participles , and the gamut of positions available to clausal subjects in both languages . june 1997 304 pp . 0-19 - 510867 - 1 paper $ 45 . 00 0-19 - 510866 - 3 cloth $ 75 . 00 oxford university press tense and aspect : from semantics to morphosyntax alessandra giorgi , university of bergamo , italy , and fabio pianesi , institute for technology and scientific research ( irst ) , trento , italy ( oxford studies in comparative syntax ) this book examines the interactions between the morphosyntax and the semantic interpretation of tense and aspect in the germanic and romance languages . these languages diverge not only in their variety of tense and aspectual forms , but also in the distribution and interpretation of given forms . adopting noam chomsky 's minimalist framework , alessandra giorgi and fabio pianesi attempt to provide theoretical explanations for the observed patterns of form and meaning which link the morphosyntactic properties of languages in both universal and language-particular constraints on interpretation . december 1997 336 pp . 0-19 - 509193 - 0 paper $ 35 . 00 0-19 - 509192 - 2 cloth $ 85 . 00 oxford university press for more information about linguistics titles from oxford university press : e-mail : linguistics @ oup-usa . org or visit the oxford university press usa web site : http : / / www . oup-usa . org oxford university press usa "	0
Subject: aspect , eventuality types and nominal semantics ; filip , hana  filip , hana ; aspect , eventuality types and nominal semantics ; 0-8153 - 3271 - 8 , cloth ; 321 pages , $ 71 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this book examines the interplay between the semantics of noun phrases and verbal predicates , with an emphasis on data drawn from czech and english , and comparisons to german and finnish . the primary focus is on shifts in readings assigned to verbal predicates between event-readings and process-readings , often called ' aspect shift ' or ' coercion ' , and how these shifts are related to the semantics of constituent noun phrases . the book examines quantificational and definite interpretations of determinerless noun phrases in czech that are induced by the semantics of grammatical aspect ( perfective and imperfective ) , and by semantic properties of verbal affixes . three main these are defended in this book . the first is that grammatical aspect and eventuality types ( state , event , and process ) are related in so far as some of their semantic properties can be modeled in terms of mereological ' part-of ' relation ( her , as a complete join semilattice ) , and this is what accounts for their systematic interactions . a second thesis is that the thematic structure of verbs governs the seemingly disparate ways in which the interactions between verbal predicates and nominal arguments are manifested . and third , we can provide a unified analysis for the various interactions between verbal predicates and nominal arguments within a constraint-based ( or unification-based ) approach to natural language description . the book also gives a detailed analysis of certain verbal affixes ( chiefly prefixes ) in slavic languages , arguing that they have the semantic properties of quantifiers , with the variable ( event or individual ) they bind also determined by the thematic structure of verbs . this book will be of interest to a wide range of linguists concerned with aspect and how it interacts with lexical semantics , morphology , syntax and quantification . available for review e - mail : infor @ garland . com 	0

how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? the workshop will be organized as a series of panels reporting on the outcome of discussions in the granada workshop ( a report summarizing the discussions at granada will be available before the coling - acl workshop ) . ample time for discussion will be included . the discussion will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas : o multi-lingual resources ( lexicons , ontologies , corpora , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation o automated ( cross-lingual ) summarization and information extraction o multimedia communication , in conjunction with text o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o methods and techniques ( both statistics-based and linguistics-based ) o parsing , generation , information acquisition , etc . o speech recognition and synthesis o language and speaker identification and speech translation program committee khalid choukri , european languages resource association charles fillmore , university of california berkeley , usa robert frederking , carnegie mellon university , usa ulrich heid , university of stuttgart , germany eduard hovy , information sciences institute , usa nancy ide , vassar college , usa mun kew leong , national university of singapore joseph mariani , limsi / cnrs , france mark maybury , the mitre corporation , usa sergei nirenburg , new mexico state university , usa akitoshi okumura , nec , japan martha palmer , university of pennsylvania , usa james pustejovsky , brandeis university , usa peter schaueble , eth zurich , switzerland oliviero stock , irst , italy felisa verdejo , uned , spain piek vossen , university of amsterdam , netherlands wolfgang wahlster , dfki , germany antonio zampolli , istituto di linguistica computazionale , italy organizers bob frederking center for machine translation carnegie - mellon university schenley park pittsburgh , pa 15213-3890 tel : ( + 1 412 ) 268-6656 fax : ( + 1 412 ) 268-6298 email : ref @ nl . cs . cmu . edu eduard hovy information sciences institute of the university of southern california 4676 admiralty way marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 tel : ( + 1 310 ) 822-1511 fax : ( + 1 310 ) 823-6714 email : hovy @ isi . edu nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , new york 12604-0520 usa tel : ( + 1 914 ) 437 5988 fax : ( + 1 914 ) 437 7498 e - mail : ide @ cs . vassar . edu 	0

Subject: ellipsis in conjunction  call for papers , focus group , zas , berlin , oct . 2 - 3 , 1998 workshop on ellipsis in conjunction in view of the growing interest in conjunction ellipsis this workshop is an attempt to promote the communication and bridge the gaps between different approaches within the framework of generative syntax . the workshop will concentrate on the following issues : ( 1 ) the structure of a conjunction construction . is the base-generated structure of a coordinate construction a double-headed structure ( williams 1994 ) , or does it have the second conjunct right-adjoined to the first conjunct ( reinhart 1991 ) , or is it a projection of a conjunction word ( &p ) ( munn1987 ) , or something else ? ( 2 ) the possible categories to be conjoined . must a conjunct be a clause or an extended projection ( excluding smaller xp - types ) ? must a conjunct be an xp ( excluding head and x ' ) ? and how are ' asymmetrical coordinations ' analyzed if only ' like ' categories can be conjoined ? ( 3 ) the analyses of ellipsis and gapping constructions . the verb gapping construction , for instance , has been analyzed as rightward np movement followed by an identical constituent deletion ( jayaseelan 1990 ) , across - the - board verb movement ( johnson 1996 ) , and deletion licensed in lf ( wilder 1997 ) . in addition , it remains to be shown how to account for the relationships between vp ellipsis , pseudogapping and gapping . furthermore , a general study of sluicing is required to cover wh in-situ languages where slucing does not alternate with an overt movement to eliminate strong features of a wh question ( lasnik 1997 ) . ( 4 ) the analysis of similarities and differences among various types of reduction . how and why do coordinative , comparative , and exception conjunction ellipses share properties and differ from each other syntactically , and / or semantically ? are the properties of forwad deletion and backward deletion related to lf and pf respectively , as claimed by wilder ( 1997 ) ? ( 5 ) the constraints on the ellipsis constructions . what are the language-specific properties that might interact with the representations of conjunction ellipsis ? are there any ellipsis or gapping rules in ug ?

"Subject: mt special issue on slt : reminder  reminder - - deadline is july 1 1998 call for submissions machine translation special issue on spoken language translation guest editor : steven krauwer ( utrecht university ) guest editorial board : doug arnold ( university of essex ) pascale fung ( hkust , hong kong ) walter kasper ( dfki , saarbrucken ) alon lavie ( cmu , pittsburgh ) lori levin ( cmu , pittsburgh ) hermann ney ( rwth , aachen ) harold somers ( umist , manchester ) some 15 years ago , when machine translation had become fashionable again in europe , few people would be prepared to consider seriously embarking upon spoken language translation research . after all , where both machine translation of written text , and speech understanding and production ( despite important achievements ) were still quite far from showing robustness in domain-independent applications , it seemed clear that putting three not even halfway understood technologies together would be premature , and bound to fail . since then , the world has changed . many researchers , both in academia and in industry , have taken up the challenge to build systems capable of translating spoken language . does that mean that most of the problems involved in speech-to - text , text-to - text translation , and text-to - speech have been solved ? the answer is no : although we have made a tremendous progress , both from a scientific and from a technological point of view , many of the fundamental problems in mt and in speech understanding remain unsolved . yet a certain degree of optimism is justified here . first of all , it is clear that on the whole general expectations of what mt will do are changing . where in the past the ultimate goal of mt seemed to be to provide a perfect , but cheaper and faster alternative to the human translator , there is now a clear shift from the ideal of fully automated high quality translation of unrestricted texts to the more practical problem of overcoming the language barriers we encounter in various situations . this shift of focus allows us to partition the problem we address into a series of smaller ones , the solution to which may be within our reach . this applies both to spoken and written language translation . if we look at spoken communication between human beings with different native languages , very often the main success criterion for this communication is not whether or not the individual utterances produced by the participants have been expressed or understood without errors ( which will rarely be the case ) , but rather whether the intended goal of the communication has been attained ( hotel room reservation , airline information , etc ) . this observation is extremely important when we try to set our goals for spoken translation systems . once we have realized that communication takes place in a specific context , with a specific goal , and have accepted that sentence-by - sentence linguistically correct translation is not a necessary condition for successful multilingual communication , we can start exploiting the full potential of spoken dialogues in human-human and human-machine interaction : the basic structure of dialogues , the ways to control dialogue flow , the possibility for repair . a workshop dedicated to spoken language translation , organized in conjunction with eacl / acl 1997 in madrid , showed that there was a keen interest in the topic , and that many acedemic and industrial research teams have interesting results to report . therefore we feel that the time has come to dedicate a special issue of the journal machine translation to this topic , and we are inviting high-quality , previously unpublished research papers addressing problems in the whole field of spoken language translation . ( note : authors who had papers accepted for the madrid workshop are especially encouraged to submit papers which have developed out of their workshop contributions , though they should note that we do not intend simply to reprint the workshop papers in their original form . ) we are especially interested in papers addressing problems or solutions that are typical for spoken language translation ( as opposed to written language translation ) . format for submission : please consult the journal 's web pages : home page : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / journalhome . htm / 0922-6567 instructions for authors : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / kaphtml . htm / ifa0922-6567 latex style files : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / jrnlstyle . htm / 0922-6567 articles should be submitted directly to the publishers , either by e-mail to ellen . klink @ wkap . nl , with the subject header "" submission to coat speech special issue "" , or in hard-copy to either of the following addresses : machine translation editorial office , machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 990 , p . o . box 230 3300 az dordrecht , accord , ma 02018-023 the netherlands u . s . a . the journal is typeset using latex , so the preferred medium for submission of articles in electronic format is latex source ( using the kluwer style file ) or gzipped postscript . if submitting hard-copy , four copies of the paper are required . the length of the papers should be approximately 10-20 pages if using the kluwer style file ( around 20k words ) . authors are requested to send a copy of an abstract of not more than 200 words to the guest editor steven . krauwer @ let . ruu . nl or in hard-copy to steven krauwer , utrecht institute of linguistics ots , trans 10 , 3512 jk utrecht , the netherlands submission deadline : submissions and abstracts should be received by july 1 1998 . papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the editorial board . we are aiming for publication as issue 3 or 4 of volume 13 ( autumn or winter , 1998 ) .

( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum "	0
"Subject: symposium meaning , metaphor & religion  symposium announcement meaning , metaphor & religion : cognitive semantics and the bible the importance of a cognitive theory of meaning for the study of religious language university of leuven , 6 - 8 july 1998 aim of the meeting this symposium aims at determining how a cognitively inspired theory of meaning ( taken in the broad sense ) provides the study of religious language with new valuable insights . specifically , it will be investigated to what extent established and ongoing research into the semantics of bible texts is supported and / or questioned by the cognitive semantic paradigm . although this meeting is primarily conceived from a linguistic point of view , it is not meant for linguists alone . instead , it explicitly aims to bring together semantic expertise from both linguistics and theology in order to explore some of the possibilities and limitations of a combined study of religious language . where ? the symposium takes place in leuven ( b ) at the historical begijnhof site ( chievre house & faculty club ) program - ralph bisschops ( brussel / duisburg ) : "" metaphors disclosing new religious experiences : lover , bride and adulteress in hosea and ezekiel "" - lieven boeve ( leuven ) : "" linguistica ancilla theologiae : the interest of fundamental theology in cognitive linguistics "" - kristin de troyer ( breda / leuven ) : "" ' and god was created . . .

"Subject: new uci dissertations in linguistics  irvine linguistics students association is pleased to announce the publication of the following two uci dissertations in linguistics . feature attraction and category movement brian k . agbayani university of california , irvine , 1998 this dissertation presents a new theory of movement in generative grammar within the framework of the minimalist program ( chomsky 1993 , 1994 , 1995 ) . the most important aspect of the new theory is that it departs from the standard view of move a as a unitary operation . the dissertation has three main goals . the first goal is to simplify the theory of feature checking in such a way that a single structural configuration ( namely , the head-adjunction structure ) holds for feature checking in both overt and covert syntax . the second goal is to present evidence for the split movement hypothesis , according to which a set of formal features and its associated category move to separate structural positions in syntax . the claim is that ug makes both attract and move available in the form of attract f and category movement , respectively . the former satisfies the formal requirement of feature checking , and the latter yields the phonological "" displacement "" effect of overt movement . the theory thus abandons the treatment of move a as a unitary operation . the third goal is to explore consequences for the proper characterization of locality in syntax . the split movement approach opens up a novel way to account for the traditional subjacency and condition on extraction domain effects ( huang 1982a ) that do not fall under chomsky 's ( 1995 ) attract f theory . it is argued that attract f and category movement are subject to different types of economy conditions , and that the traditional subjacency and condition on extraction domain effects should not be given a unified account , contrary to the barriers approach ( chomsky 1986a ) . the theory also derives a number of previously mysterious properties related to cross linguistic variation in extractability out of islands , the relative strength of island effects , and the nature of successive-cyclic movement . this dissertation presents a new approach to movement in syntax which overcomes the conceptual and empirical shortcomings of the traditional approach , while gaining new insights into previously mysterious phenomena and properties of natural languages . : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : parametrization of features in syntax sze - wing tang university of california , irvine , 1998 the major focus of this study is to propose a restrictive theory of parameters of universal grammar in terms of the principles-and - parameters approach . i propose that semantic features are invariant across languages ; only features that may play a role in the derivation from n to the pf interface level including phonetic features , categorial features , and affix features are subject to parametric variation , which is called the ' overt parametrization hypothesis ' ( oph ) . it is argued that where affix features are associated with a word is subject to parametric variation . movement is largely determined by morphology : movement in the overt component can be signaled by ' impoverished ' morphology ; movement of morphologically ' rich ' elements takes place in the phonological component . under this approach , a variety of syntactic differences among chinese ( cantonese and mandarin ) , english , french , japanese , navajo , and hebrew can be accounted for . based on the idea of parametrization of affix features , i claim that t has an affix feature [ - v ] in english . such an affix feature is missing in chinese . consequently , there is no v - to - t movement in chinese and v moves out of vp in english . a number of apparently disparate differences between these two languages , including postverbal no-phrases , the distribution of focus elements , binominal each , the ' sov ' focalization construction , scopal ambiguity of quantifiers , definiteness of preverbal numeral phrases , gapping , and heavy np shift , receive a unified explanation . the data presented as evidence for the claim that categorial features are subject to parametric variation are primarily based on small clauses in chinese , english , and japanese . it is argued that chinese small clauses are bare , english small clauses are ' not-so - bare ' , and japanese allows both types of small clauses . the major typological differences among these languages regarding the structure of small clauses are derived from a parameter related to the combination of categorial features of nouns and adjectives . the findings lend support to the oph . : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : also available : > uci dissertations in linguistics griffith , teresa a . 1996 projecting transitivity and agreement ikawa , hajime 1996 overt movement as a reflex of morphology ishii , toru 1997 an asymmetry in the composition of phrase structure and its consequences li , xiaoguang 1997 deriving distributivity in mandarin chinese takano , yuji 1996 movement and parametric variation in syntax zoerner , cyril edward 1995 coordination : the syntax of &p us $ 14 each , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 3 ( 1997 ) . edited by luther > chen - sheng liu and kazue takeda articles appearing in the third volume are : brian agbayani : category raising , adjunction , and minimality lisa lai - shen cheng : "" partial "" wh - movement naoki fukui : attract and the a - over - a principle toru ishii : the "" crossing "" constraint and the minimal link condition luther chen - sheng liu : light verb and accusative - ing gerund in taiwanese yuji takano : scrambling and partial object shift kazue takeda : a note on locality of category movement and feature movement sze - wing tang : the parametric approach to the resultative construction in chinese and english miyoko yashui : identification of ellipses and other empty categories us $ 14 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 2 : proceedings of the south > western optimality theory workshop ( swot ii ) . edited by brian agbayani > and naomi harada us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 1 . edited by brian agbayani , > kazue takeda and sze - wing tang us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling shipping and handling ( per item ) domestic : $ 4 ;

"Subject: wholes and their parts  wholes and their parts ( w / p ) bolzano , maretsch castle , 17-19 june 1998 1 . presentation science is connected to the complementarity of analysis and synthesis . it may be said that classical physics is characterized by an in-built analysis of the world into constituent parts ( such as atoms or elementary particles ) . these are then recomposed together to provide , by means of synthesis , any system ; interactions are linearly and locally described ; the resulting hierarchy of structures is grounded on such constituent parts . in contemporary science , the age of "" pure "" analysis seems to have ended . there are deep mathematical reasons for this . non - linear systems have properties that , in general , cannot be expressed in terms of decomposition into ultimate , unstructured , pointlike parts plus a suitable sets of relations among them . moreover , the "" dialectic "" of quantity and quality is subtler than was previously thought and this dialectic is needed in the explanation of all sorts of phenomena . it arises not only in physics , but also in the study of cognitive systems and natural and programming languages . within psychology , it is said that "" gestalten "" are cohesive wholes and that "" the whole is more than the sum of its parts "" . but what does this mean exactly ? similar questions emerge in other contexts as well . what is relevant for the foundations of science , the need for a clear understanding of the part / whole relationships , emerges even in logic and mathematics , since these provide the tools for organizing our rational image of the world , in its multi-stratified complexity . thus , we are faced with the problem of relating in a possibly coherent way the various forms of part / whole relationships arising in different branches of science . we have not only to classify the different kinds of wholes and their inherent "" grammars "" , but also to take into account the process of formation for wholes , in order to describe precisely in which sense the whole emerges out of its parts and is irreducible to an aggregate of autonomous , more or less pointlike , entities . what makes ( in part , at least ) the difference between mere aggregates and cohesive wholes ? the members of the whole do not simply hang together : they hang together in the whole , and the structure of the whole influences the description of the parts and their local interactions . in view of the growing interest in this sort of pattern , of so deep relevance for theoretical and applied sciences , it is therefore suitable to clarify the whole / part issues in crucial fields of research , to compare different approaches and to develop a foundational discussion . 2 . program june 17 9 registration 10 bill lawvere , opening lecture 11 , 30 coffee break 12 john bell , w / p in algebraic and logical structures 13-15 lunch 15 ieke moerdjik , w / p in geometry , topology and topos theory 16 coffee break 16 , 30 colin mclarty , w / p in foundations of mathematics 17 , 30 carlo cellucci , w / p in logical analysis june 18 9 steve vickers , w / p in semantics for programming languages 10 gonzalo reyes , w / p in categorical analysis of language 11 coffee break 11 , 30 john mayberry , w / p in set theory 12 , 30-15 lunch 15 niles eldredge , w / p in biology 16 coffee break 16 , 30 alberto peruzzi , w / p in epistemology and semantics 17 , 30 roberto poli , w / p in ontology june 19 9 ettore casari , w / p in phenomenology 10 alf zimmer , w / p in gestalt psychology 11 coffee break 11 , 30 ron langacker , w / p in linguistics 12 , 30-15 lunch 15 george lakoff , w / p in cognitive sciences ( to be confirmed ) 16 coffee break 16 , 30 chris isham , w / p in quantum topology 17 , 30 basil hiley , w / p in mechanics and cosmology 3 . updates to keep you updated with more information on the conference this is the url for the w / p home page : http : / / www . gelso . unitn . it / ~ poli / 4 . registration fees registration fees only cover the participation in this conference . miscellaneous expenses ( accomodation , meals and social activities ) are in addition . the registration deadline to get the early registration fare is : march 1998 , 31st . students must enclose with the registration form a photocopy of their student card . status early registration ( before 3 / 31 / 98 ) late registration student 50 , 000 100 , 000 scholar 100 , 000 200 . 000 industrial 200 , 000 300 . 000 5 . accomodation participants should book their own accomodation . a selected hotel list is the following one : parkhotel laurin * * * * . 4 , laurinstrasse single-room and breakfast : 180 , 000-265 , 000 tel . + 39 471 31 10 00 , fax + 39 471 31 11 48 citta \ 146 * * * . 21 , waltherplatz single-room and breakfast : 110 , 000 tel . + 39 471 97 52 21 ;

"Subject: foreign language culture  conference organizer : faculty of foreign languages laboratory of communicative teaching through cultural interaction . kursk state pedagogical university . 33 radischev street , kursk 305004 , russia tel . ( 071 22 ) 2-73 - 61 fax . ( 0712 ) 568461 e-mail : kgpu @ home . sovtest . ru international conference : the voice of the foreign language culture tentatively scheduled for october 12-16 , 1998 at kursk state pedagogical university , russia . goal : defining general approaches taken by russian and foreign methodologists to the problem of communicative pronunciation teaching . foreign language pronunciation , vital for communication , is a complex phenomenon difficult to investigate and not readily yielding to teaching guidance . no wonder , occasionally it will be declared irrelevant and the attention of the methodologists and teachers is concentrated on more learnable items : grammar and vocabulary . indeed , either the intuitive - imitative approach with its attention to the accuracy of pronunciation or the analytic - linguistic approach with its articulatory and contrastive information , or the cognitive approach which gives emphases to grammar , or the natural approach and the silent way with the attention to the supra - segmental structures have not met the needs of communication . however , this kind of neglect of pronunciation teaching is of short duration and it could not be otherwise for evident reasons . it is pronunciation that reflects the national character , culture and spirit of the nation , the social characteristics of the speaker , their aims , motives and emotions . you would not really respond adequately to what is being said without the proper awareness of the implications of the pronunciation system . moreover , even in the recognition of grammar and lexical units we mainly depend on pronunciation parameters . in fact , all speech activities have pronunciation roots . that is why we can not neglect teaching pronunciation if we want to prepare our students for actual communication . in the communicative approach adhered to in this institution , we demand a communicative paradigm of pronunciation teaching . it implies both the communicative aim of teaching and structuring the teaching process in accordance with the natural mechanisms of pronunciation acquisition . there is evidence that communicative approach to teaching pronunciation is gaining universal support . according to m . celces - murcia , d . m . brinton , j . m . goodwin in "" teaching pronunciation , "" _ cup _ , 1996 . . . teaching supra-segmental features ( rhythm , stress and intonation in a discourse context was the optimal way to organize a short - term pronunciation course . this idea sounds promising for a more fundamental course if we take into account the psychological nature of pronunciation acquisition . the objectives of the conference are as follows : emphasize social importance and necessity of correct pronunciation point out general problems of teaching fl pronunciation develop a communicative syllabus for teaching fl pronunciation and specify the teaching units and the context of teaching definine communicative strategies for pronunciation teaching specify the communicative model for teaching pronunciation and its correlation with natural speech mechanisms define the links of fl culture and pronunciation teaching analyze the communicative model of pronunciation teaching as a component of teacher education outline the linguistic foundation of communicative fl pronunciation teaching identify the links between pronunciation and grammar , vocabulary and pragmatic context . discussion groups on suggested topics : 1 . the social load and the status of pronunciation in multi-cultural society . 2 . pronunciation as an indicator of language proficiency and cultural level . 3 . communicative teaching of pronunciation as a basis for teaching fl speech . 4 . functional and linguistic aspects of pronunciation teaching . 5 . techniques of communicative teaching of fl pronunciation . we would be delighted to discuss the problems and share our experience with those of similar interests . we sincerely hope that the integral efforts of the participants of the conference will result in solving some of the problems and enrich our practical competence . first call for papers . the faculty of foreign languages and the laboratory of communicative fl teaching through cultural interaction at kursk state pedagogical university ( russia ) cordially invite colleagues from asia , africa , america and europe to participate in their international conference . we desire to share achievements , concerns and exchange expertise in teaching english , german and french phonetics and pronunciation . all teachers and methodologists are welcome to attend . papers of 2000 words will be published subsequently in the conference proceedings . final date for acceptance of applications and papers to the above address by 1 july 1998 . kursk , a city lacated 450 km to the south of moscow , is one of the oldest cities in russia with a number of attractions interesting from historical and cultural points of view . accomodation will be provided at the hotel kursk ( 40-60 $ per night ) . participants will also be offered to live in the appartments with russian families and the students ' dormitory . foreign particapants will be met in moscow and accompanied to kursk if required . we look forward to hearing from you . sincerely , nickolay smakhtin dean of the faculty of foreign languages vyacheslav buzhinsky head of the english language department "	0

Subject: workshop annoncement and call for papers - clitics  workshop announcement and call for papers c l i t i c s 24th - 26th february 1999 konstanz university , germany we are pleased to announce our workshop on ' clitics ' during the 21st annual meeting of the german society of linguistics in konstanz ( germany ) . in linguistic research , clitics play an increasingly prominent role . the status of clitics is under discussion in phonology , morphology , and syntax , as well as in the respective interfaces . in these fields , the discussion on clitics gives rise to controversial analyses . one open question is whether we need in fact a separate linguistic category ' clitic ' , or whether these elements can be subsumed under different linguistic categories , such as affixes . - with respect to phonology , it is undetermined how clitics are incorporated into phonological structure . should we distinguish a clitic group in the prosodic hierarchy , are clitics part of prosodic words , or are they left outside prosodic structure ? how is their phonological deficiency best accounted for ? - concerning the morphology of clitics , especially regarding the occurrence of opaque clitics in clitic clusters , analyses within the framework of distributed morphology compete with those which propose an optimality theoretic solution . - also , the morphosyntactic status of clitics is unclear . is it possible to capture the order of clitics in clitic clusters in a more explanatory way than in terms of templates ? the complex conditions on clitic doubling give rise to the question whether clitics should be analysed as agreement markers or as arguments . - syntactic aspects of clitics play a major role in recent analyses in different theoretical frameworks . for instance , there is no agreement on the explanation of clitic climbing and it is an unsettled issue whether clitic placement should be accounted for in a syntactic , prosodic , prosodic-syntactic , or optimality-theoretic approach . the workshop intends to bring together phonologists , morphologists , and syntacticians and provides an ideal opportunity to share insights and to discuss the issues mentioned above . in addition to the invited speaker presentations , there are 9 slots for 30 - minute presentations , and 3 slots for 1 hour presentations ( including discussion ) . invited speakers : geert booij ( free university amsterdam ) jane grimshaw ( rutgers university ) juan uriagereka ( university of maryland ) please send a one-page abstract before 15th august 1998 to : birgit gerlach & janet grijzenhout , seminar fuer allgemeine sprachwissenschaft , heinrich - heine - universitaet , universitaetsstr . 1 , 40225 duesseldorf , germany . we may be contacted by e-mail at gerlach @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de , or grijzenh @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de 	0

"Subject: special issue machine translation : final call for papers  final call for papers the machine translation journal special issue on anaphora resolution in machine translation guest editor : ruslan mitkov ( university of wolverhampton ) the interpretation of anaphora is crucial for the successful operation of a machine translation system . in particular , it is essential to resolve the anaphoric relation when translating into languages which mark the gender of pronouns . unfortunately , the majority of mt systems developed in the seventies and eighties did not adequately address the problems of identifying the antecedents of anaphors in the source language and producing the anaphoric "" equivalents "" in the target language . as a consequence , only a limited number of mt systems have been successful in translating discourse , rather than isolated sentences . one reason for this situation is that in addition to anaphora resolution being itself a very complicated task , translation adds a further dimension to the problem in that the reference to a discourse entity encoded by a source language anaphor by the speaker ( or writer ) has not only to be identified by the hearer ( translator or translation system ) but also re-encoded in a coreferential expression in a different language . the nineties have seen an intensification of research efforts in anaphora resolution in machine translation . this can be seen in the growing number of related projects which have reported promising new results ( e . g . wada 1990 ; leass & schwall 1991 ; nakaiwa & ikehara 1992 ; chen 1992 ; saggion & carvalho 1994 ; preuss et al . 1994 ; nakaiwa et al . 1994 ; nakaiwa et al . 1995 ; nakaiwa & ikehara 1995 ; mitkov et al . 1995 ; mitkov et al . 1997 ; geldbach 1997 ) . however , we still feel that additional work is needed to highlight and further explore the specifics of the problem in operational mt environments , including fully automatic machine translation and machine - aided translation . we are inviting high-quality , original research papers describing recent advances in anaphora resolution in machine translation . topics to be addressed include ( but are not limited to ) - operational anaphora resolution components in machine translation - resolution of zero pronouns in mt environments - lexical transfer of anaphors across languages - to what extent have the latest trends towards knowledge-poor , corpus - driven and robust approaches in anaphora resolution , been called upon in machine translation ? - what are the most scalable contributory factors / resolution strategies in mt ? - what makes anaphora resolution a more complex task in machine translation ? - multilingual anaphora resolution submission and format articles should be submitted directly to the publishers , either by e-mail to ellen . klink @ wkap . nl , with the subject header "" submission to coat anaphora special issue "" , or in hard-copy to machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 990 3300 az dordrecht the netherlands or machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 230 accord , ma 02018-023 u . s . a . the submission deadline is 15 may 1998 . the journal is typeset using latex , so the preferred medium for submission of articles in electronic format is latex source ( using the kluwer style file ) or gzipped postscript . for more details , please consult the journal 's web pages : home page : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / journalhome . htm / 0922-6567 instructions for authors : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / kaphtml . htm / ifa0922-6567 latex style files : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / jrnlstyle . htm / 0922-6567 if submitting hard-copy , four copies of the paper are required . the length of the papers should be approximately 10-20 pages if using the kluwer style file ( around 20k words ) . authors are also requested to send a copy of an abstract of not more than 200 words to the guest editor r . mitkov @ wlv . ac . uk or in hard-copy to ruslan mitkov , school of languages and european studies , university of wolverhampton , stafford st . , wolverhampton wv1 1sb , united kingdom . guest editor : ruslan mitkov school of languages and european studies university of wolverhampton stafford st . wolverhampton wv1 1sb telephone ( 44-1902 ) 322471 fax ( 44-1902 ) 322739 email r . mitkov @ wlv . ac . uk guest editorial board : breck baldwin ( university of pennsylvania , philadelphia ) david carter ( sri international , cambridge ) guenter goerz ( university of nuernberg / erlangen ) lynette hirschman ( mitre , mclean ) richard kittredge ( university of montreal ) susan luperfoy ( mitre , mclean ) tony mcenery ( lancaster university ) ruslan mitkov ( university of wolverhampton ) frederique segond ( ranx xerox , grenoble ) harold somers ( umist , manchester ) keh - yih su ( national tsing hua university , taiwan ) yorick wilks ( university of sheffield ) "	0

- - - - - - - - - constraint - based theories of phonology have become enormously popular in recent years . such theories express generalizations by stating how and when a language 's phonological forms are constrained , rather than relying on rules that actively modify the forms . computational ideas have often provided an impetus for these innovations . koskenniemi 's ( 1983 ) 2 - level morphophonological processor introduced parallel constraining relations as an alternative to an ordered system of rewrite rules . declarative phonology ( c 1990 ) focusses on the unity of representations and rules as constraints , drawing on various computational ideas from unification to temporal logic to finite-state calculi . one current constraint-based theory is optimality theory ( ot ) ( prince&smolensky 1993 ) . this theory found , at least partial , inspiration in computational work by smolensky on the relation between symbolic and subsymbolic computation . although this link with connectionism has been left largely unexplored , ot has proved to be a computationally productive theory , giving rise to several theoretical papers on computational issues related to complexity and learnability , as well as inspiring a number of implementations . this workshop is designed to foster the link between computational work and constraint-based phonology in general . to this end , it invites submissions on topics related to the computation of any constraint-based phonological formalism , including but not limited to the three mentioned above . here are some example topics : * the computational interpretation of phonological theories , * constraint ranking and interaction , eg . as in ot , * implementations of particular analyses , * results in the complexity of constraint application , * algorithms for learning constraints or constraint ranking , * results on the learnability of such constraints , * novel formalisms for constraint-based phonology , * representational issues raised by constraint-based approaches . in short , papers are invited which address computational issues in constraint-based theories of phonology . submission -

"" making sense "" sounds reassuringly uncontroversial , and it has taken the insights of jerome bruner in the 1960s , and of michael halliday and his associates in recent years , to bring out the richness of meaning that this expression can carry . it is now widely accepted that sense is not simply "" there "" in the world , waiting to be discovered and documented , but that it is actually created by human beings in societies . the idea that "" reality "" is "" created "" in language also implies that there must be more than one reality , and that a number of realities can be articulated and compared . these possibilities carry major implications for language education , social identity and participation - - or , less reassuringly , for educational and social exclusion . the thematic emphasis of this conference on "" creating sense "" , then , includes the essential notions that any single form of sense can also be questioned and "" unmade "" , and that alternative kinds of sense can be remade or "" re-created "" through texts . making , unmaking and remaking meanings are fundamental aspects of social and educational experience , from infancy through primary and secondary school years and beyond , continuing into adulthood and maturity . much education has to do with learning to think , talk and write about things in ways that differ from the initial "" commonsense "" knowledge or belief that children have already acquired in their communities . to bring this about without undermining what is valid and valued in children 's lives is an enormously challenging and problematic social and cultural activity . that it is also a necessary one can be argued both in terms of mainstream rationality ( the development of scientific thinking being a prime example here ) and of critical awareness , which includes learning to deconstruct powerful people 's accounts of how the world is and ought to be , and to propose alternative accounts . full participation in social and political life is only possible when people have learned , as ronald carter has put it , how to "" see through language "" . these concerns over creating , questioning and re-creating sense are explored in this conference in relation to two domains , those of language education and media studies . in the context of formal education , learners have both to discern meaning in what is offered to them and actively to make "" their own "" meanings as they interpret and analyse experience from a variety of perspectives which may be proposed to them or discovered by them . all this raises important issues of participation and exclusion relating to learners ' personal and social explorations of language , and the ways in which these two modes of exploration may be related . the conference will pursue these concerns in the broad context of language education as its first domain . the second conference domain is that of media studies , with particular attention to media discourse and reality construction . the conference seeks to bring to light some of the ways in which realities , like stories , are invented , told , represented and mediated through available technologies . diverse experiences and accounts of reality are constructed through the interplay of language and image . these can , for instance , be presented as fantasies , fictional explorations of experience , docu-dramas or documentary coverage of events , among other things . the impact of such accounts on audiences and "" the public "" depends on many social , cultural and educational factors , but the need for modern citizens to be able to make their own sense of accounts that are offered to them , and also to offer accounts of their own , increasingly appears fundamental to effective social participation as well as to social critique . the conference looks to stimulate debate that is grounded in - - - or informedly set against - - - current theories , practices and findings of teaching and research communities in language and communication studies . another main aim is to suggest guidelines for informed , responsible and reflective practice in the domains of language education and media studies . a theme of particular interest , to be developed especially in workshop mode , is that of materials writing for educational purposes in both conference domains .

"Subject: review : watt , phonology of intonation .  watt , david l . e . 1994 . _ the phonology and semology of intonation in english : an instrumental and systemic perspective . _ bloomington : indiana university linguistics club publications . 192pp . paper . reviewed by karen steffen chung < karchung @ ccms . ntu . edu . tw > good books on intonation are not that easy to come by , in this reviewer 's opinion , but this should be considered one of them . it is not an introductory text that will take you through english intonation in a systematic way . and the book 's ostensible main thesis , which concerns the semantic interpretation of various intonation ' melodies ' , is not its primary attraction , either . what it offers is a solid collection of valuable observations , in bits and pieces , on english intonation . so i think that the best way to do justice to a book like this in a review is to simply pick out what i found to be some of the more interesting points and condense them here , without too much additional commentary . * * * * * * * * intonation as a subfield of linguistics is still wide open to pioneering work . the author describes intonation as one of the ' most puzzling and idiosyncratic ' aspects of human speech within the sphere of language as behavior , and he points out the role of intonation in the 'd ynamism of discourse ' ( from the preface ) . unlike another work in this series recently reviewed for linguist , taylor 's _ a phonetic model of intonation in english _ , this book focuses mainly on * language * as we speak and hear it , rather than on mechanical - and often difficult-to - interpret - computer models , though computer recorded and analyzed data is also used to help analyze stretches of speech in this study . watt concludes that since instrumentation is far from infallible , and the human ear can also be quite subjective in what it hears , the most reliable method is to use auditory impressions for the initial recording of data , and instrumentally collected data as a supplement . the book starts out with a useful introduction , in which terms are defined and goals set . the two sections of the main body stress the development of a phonological and semantic model of intonation , respectively . these are divided into two chapters each , entitled ( part i ) : "" the phonology of intonation "" , and "" tones in sequences "" ; and ( part ii ) : "" intonation and meaning "" , and "" the semantics of phonological gradience "" . two appendices of instrumental data from recorded speech consist of selected examples taken from halliday 's _ course in spoken english : intonation _ ( 1970 ) , and from a corpus compiled by the author . the book concludes with 14 pages of references . the data come from ' non-surreptitious ' but unmonitored , casual 'd iadic conversations ' between native speakers of ' educated standard toronto english ' - rather rare in a field where most of the works are based on british rp or standard us english . the author points out that the data are not intended to contrast with those taken from other varieties of english ; his main goal was to achieve consistency in the speech form used . among the power and distance parameters of social and personal relations , the author chooses for his data collection ' equal ' , over 's uperordinate ' and 's ubordinate ' ; ' acquainted ' , as opposed to ' intimate ' or ' foreign ' ; and ' face-to - face ' rather than 'd istance ' ( i . e . phone conversations , subject to various kinds of distortion , were excluded ) . intonation is a suprasegmental ( i . e . ' a feature whose domain extends over more than one segment ' ) feature of language , and the author adopts a _ prosodic _ ( ' the use of pitch contours to realize linguistic meaning ' ) approach in analyzing it . below follow some a few other terms as watt uses them in his study . _ tonality _ refers to the division of the message into phonological tone groups or ' information units ' ( iu ) . _ tonicity _ involves a process of locating the salient syllable in a tone group , the ' focal point of ideational meaning in the information unit ; each group must contain at least one tonic syllable , which is located at the onset of pitch movement associated with nuclear tone contour ' . _ tone _ refers to the selection of one of five simple or two compound tone contours that phonologically realize interpersonal meanings in the iu . particular tone choice can mediate speaker / hearer relations ( e . g . indicate the need for a response , change of turn , or continuation ) or mediate speaker-message relations : i . e . attitudes toward a message , such as reservation , certainty or assertion ( pp . 18-20 ) . also defined is _ paratone _ , a larger intonational unit , which cannot extend beyond a breath group ; and no larger intonational unit was found in this study . section one begins by proposing that a theory of intonation must strive to make two different kinds of descriptions , namely , ( 1 ) a phonological one , which emphasizes identification of nuclear tones and other refinements derived from instrumental analysis , and ( 2 ) a semantic description of the functional impetus responsible for motivating language behavior , which includes tone sequences , intertonal relations , paratones , and connected speech . section one concentrates on ( 1 ) . watt describes _ simple tones _ - namely ( 1 ) simple falling , ( 2 ) simple high rise ( with fall-rise option ) , and ( 3 ) low rise - and _ complex tones _ , which consist of more than one pitch movement and are naturally more complicated . these are : ( 4 ) , which occurs on the last two syllables of the final word of an utterance and reaches the top level of pitch , then falls sharply , and ( 5 ) , which consists of a rise-fall movement , with the intensity on the rise . there are also _ compound tones _ , i . e . combinations of simple tones fused into a single tone group . there are two compound tones , 1 + 3 , and 5 + 3 . watt notes that some researchers have proposed a model of intonational meaning similar to that of grammar , in which one compound tone is linked with one particular meaning or function . but intonation in fact does * not * function like this - intonation is a realization of * semantics * rather than syntax . the interpretation of intonation must be made within the context of grammar , but it is not linked element by element to the syntax . as g . brown ( only first initials are given in the references ) puts it : ' the phonological resources for signaling meaning are far fewer than the semantic functions which "" exploit "" them ' ( p . 73 ) . a notable pattern revealed by instrumental analysis of spoken data is _ downdrift _ , a declining of the fundamental frequency ( f0 ) over the span of short utterances for a wide range of languages . it oscillates between the two extremes of an equally descending and slightly narrowing bandwidth with sentence final fall and slight prolongation at the breath group boundary . the declination slope is not always constant , but it can be a series of descending plateaux , or sets of declination lines . this model is not as 's usceptible ' to errors of data interpretation as following individual nuclear tones can be ( pp . 66-71 ) . section two concentrates on developing a semantic model of intonation , i . e . providing an initial account of meaning often attributed to intonation . watt here advances his view that intonational meaning can be derived both from phonological contrasts of tone and tonicity and from the phonetic gradience characteristic of these contrasts . there is less consistency in generalizing the meaning of intonation than with a phonological description of sound substance due to ( 1 ) the nature of intonation and ( 2 ) the variety of inferences people draw from voice-related cues . as members of a speech community , we make inferences about what is meant both by what is said and how it is said . we must draw conclusions on discrete meanings from only * part * of the speech continuum ( and not include e . g . physical appearance of the speaker in our analysis ) . to deal with the semantics of intonation , you can take either a linguistic approach , in which you look at meaning * contrasts * and form-to - function correspondences , or you can take a psychological approach , in which ' polar clines ' are posited , e . g . bored vs . interested , or timid vs . confident ; watt addresses only the * linguistic * contribution of ' tonicity ' and ' tone ' ( p . 76 ff . ) . watt refers to halliday , who stresses the ideation function of intonation , how it highlights information for specific attention , i . e . given vs . new , also fresh vs . contrasted . the stressing of new information is an outcome of 's peaker assessed importance ' . the tonic of unmarked utterances will tend to fall on the last lexical item of the tone group ; this results in a broad , ' unspecified ' focus ; this focus is narrowed in a ' contrastive ' utterance ( p . 79 ) . intonation has an ' interpersonal metafunction ' by serving as a channel for linguistic expression of * attitude * , though it is not the only such channel . other channels include register and lexicon ; and sometimes certain stylistic effects can be achieved by combining incongruous linguistic content and intonations , e . g . imagine ' put that goddam pipe away ! ' uttered in a smiling , gentle tone of voice . so the listener 's perception of the speaker 's attitude may be based on two or more signals combined ( p . 87 ) . intonation adds information to disambiguate speech function . speech function is identified and interpreted through the cumulative effect of contextual , morpho-syntactic and phonological cues ( p . 91 ) . it can include competition for turns ( an initiating peak can be used for this ) , initiating a topic ( marked by an initial peak of intensity and high pitch ) , continuing ( upward drift ) , responding ( the second speaker approximates the relative pitch height of the baseline of the last utterance produced by the previous speaker , i . e . an accommodation of one speaker 's melodic pattern to that of another ) , terminating ( fall to the lowest level of the speaker 's voice range ; a termination often falls well above the baseline before its final fall ) , checking function ( conversation monitoring with sporadic checks on the status of the conversation , i . e . checking that the hearer understands , agrees on the appropriateness of what is being expressed , and is still engaged ; this is intended to elicit a response from the hearer , but usually involves no change of turn , e . g . ' is n't it ? ' , ' right ? ' , ' you know ' , ' eh ' ) , certainty ( speakers can indicate ' certainty known / absolute ' , ' certainty irrelevant / conditional ' , or ' certainty unknown / assumed ' ) . watt points out that a major difficulty of doing description of intonation is the inherently gradient characteristic of the spoken medium . there is a gradient between the linguistic and the paralinguistic , as well as a division between what constitutes a linguistic contrast and what signals a modification of the phonological cline within that contrast . watt offers a revealing quote from bolinger : ' the higher the rise , the greater the exasperation if it is a statement , the greater the surprise of curiosity if it is a question . the lower the fall the greater the certainty or finality if the utterance is a statement , and the greater the confidence if it is a question ' [ 1986 : 240 ] . that is , in watt 's own words : ' . . . the greater the degree of the rise , or the height of a given contour , the greater the strength of the contextual meaning assumed for that contour ' ( p . 109 ) . watt sums his work up nicely - and what he says could easily be applied to just about any worthy field of inquiry - in the final chapter thus : ' there is a certain fractal logic that seems to pervade the investigation of intonation . the more we magnify the field under scrutiny , in the hopes of reaching an explanation of its details , the more we find new and unexpected details in need of explanation . the deeper we probe into the next level of detail , the more difficult it becomes to extricate ourselves from its detail with a parsimonious description of the new possibilities ' ( p . 121 ) . in addition to recapping the highlights of his book in the conclusion , watt offers his vision for what his work has to contribute to the field in general , namely , a ' compatible point of departure from which to further the description of discourse ' ( p . 122 ) . he believes that accurate synthesizing of intonations may possibly add to our knowledge about our auditory perceptions , and that can also help further develop our models of synthesized speech . * * * * * * * * although the book 's basic structure is clearly set out in the section and chapter titles , the contents of each subdivision are diverse and often hard to incorporate into a coherent , linear narrative on intonation ; one must content oneself with the fragments one is able to latch onto . yet one has the feeling that much is being said in this motley collection of ideas , observations , and analyses , much more than in many other of the works on intonation available . and for this reason , the interested reader is advised to bear with the author , take notes , and enjoy the ride . this book has a rather amateurish , low-budget look , perhaps to be expected from university publications of this kind . the instrumental graphs bordered by thick black outlines and incorporated into the chapters in many places seem stuffed in a little too close to the written text , though there is no problem of clarity . the text itself is set in a relatively large serif typeface , which makes for comfortable reading , though occasionally some startlingly inconsistent type sizes turn up . new concepts ( e . g . _ paratone _ , _ concord _ ) appear in bold and are easily spotted . minor typos appear here and there . the diy look of the design is not a serious flaw , though , for anyone after unalloyed content , of which you get plenty in this book . overall , this is a worthwhile and rather refreshing book for someone seriously interested in intonation . the reader had better be ready , however , to invest a bit of work to mine it of its wealth . reviewed by karen steffen chung , department of foreign languages and literatures , national taiwan university , taipei .

verlag as volume 862 of the lectures notes in artificial intelligence , and the third international colloquium on grammatical inference , held at montpellier in france , the proceedings of which were published by springer - verlag as volume 1147 of the lecture notes in artificial intelligence . following the success of these events and the workshop on automata induction , grammatical inference , and language acquisition , held in conjunction with the international conference on machine learning at nashville in united states in july 1997 , the fourth international colloquium on grammatical inference will be held from july 12 through july 14 , 1998 , at iowa state university in united states . -

- - whether it appears in physical form on paper , in electronic form on-line , or mixed in with another modality such as graphics or video - - - will bring with it some unknown mix of noisy natural language data as well as non-linguistic data . how are systems with an mt component to be designed and evaluated given the challenge this input brings ? the objective of this workshop is to examine and evaluate techniques for adjusting this "" linguistic impedance mismatch "" between the real-world input and the natural language input expected by various mt engines . thus the workshop will focus on computational approaches to preprocessing system input for mt engines andon statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component . linguistic preprocessing in image data for researchers working with image data , there is currently underway an effort to augment ocr ( optical character recognition ) engines with linguistic data as they recognize and convert bitmap data into characters - - - similar to what has already been done in speech recognition with linguistic data in hmms ( hidden markov models ) . other ocr researchers have also experimented with image-level early topic detection using word-shape recognition . in principle , this could provide a first-step filtering of documents into a more homogeneous mt input set , a desirable goal for mt evaluation . thus we expect that individuals working with or intending to incorporate ocr into their computer systems will be interested in this new area . linguistic preprocessing in online data for those working with online input , even though the characters are already present , there often still remains the task of preprocessing meaningful , symbolic character strings that are not a part of the text to be translated . for some systems , the rules for identifying and encapsulating or removing such strings may need to be hand-crafted over time as mt engine limitations surface . for others , a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistically trained nl models has worked . many have observed that the html annotations , alphanumeric items , spreadsheet and word processing codes are harder to weed out than originally expected . research efforts with the low-density and less-commonly taught languages , as well as more common ones , encounter a substantial problem with variation in spelling conventions and transcription preferences . for those natural languages that are primarily spoken and not written , for example , this is frequently the case . researchers working on this class of problem have built variants on spell checkers ( sc ) , components that standardize words to one orthography ( spelling convention ) before submitting it to an mt engine . an idea that has arisen for this component is to build in an option to adjust the level of sc correction - - - as would be relevant when input after ocr nonetheless varies from very noisy to relatively clean . evaluation of embedded mt systems among those working on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component , we have seen two distinct trends . one group of statisticians has begun looking for appropriate models from outside the world of mt evaluation , examining the efforts by others to take distinct metrics for components and combine them for an overall system-level metric using fuzzy mathematics . another group of researchers is looking instead at developing a one-dimensional scale for ranking mt engines along a continuum defined by system-level function . that approach , for example , might rank one engine as good enough for filtering documents , while another engine deemed more linguistically robust would be ranked higher because it could generate a good enough initial translation for subsequent post-editing . we welcome other functional evaluations of mt components and computer systems with embedded mt components as well . submissions submitters are invited to send in a short paper , not more than 5 pages , addressing one or more of the three areas discussed above . papers should define the problem in an embedded mt system that is the focus of the work , describe the embedded mt system design ( a simple sketch ) with sample input data where relevant , and present their approach to the problem . work at various stages of completion is acceptable ; we expect the current status of the work to be made clear . submission of end-to - end output of an embedded mt system is especially encouraged . the papers will be collected and distributed to participants of theworkshop . ideally , the result of the workshop will be a clearer delineation of : ( 1 ) the range of linguistic preprocessing problems ( 2 ) the range of designs in embedded mt systems ( 3 ) how these problems aretreated in different embedded mt systems and ( 4 ) the metrics that are being used to evaluate these systems and their components . dates notice of interest in participation : july 10 , 1998 ( to voss @ arl . mil ) please identify which of the three areas you intend to address : preprocessing in image data , preprocessing in online data , evaluation of embedded mt systems . position paper submission : august 10 , 1998 notifications : september 10 , 1998 final copies of papers : october 10 , 1998 workshop : october 28 , 1998 submissions may be in printed or electronic form . submissions should be sent to : clare voss army research laboratory amsrl-is -

Subject: translation  translation into the second language stuart campbell paper 0 582 30188 2 224 pages 1998 applied linguistics and language study series longman the dynamics of immigration , international commerce and the postcolonial world make it inevitable that much translation is done into a second language , despite the prevailing wisdom that translators should only work into their mother tongue . this book is the first study to explore the phenomenon of translation into a second language in a way that will interest applied linguists , translators and translation teachers , and esol teachers working with advanced level students . rather than seeing translation into a second language as deficient output , this study adopts an interlanguage framework to consider l2 translation as the product of developing competence ; learning to translate is seen as a special variety of second language acquisition . through carefully worked case studies , separate components of translation competence are identified , among them the ability to create stylistically authentic texts in english , the ability to monitor and edit output , and the psychological attitudes that the translator brings to the task . while the case studies mainly deal with arabic speakers undergoing translator training in australia , the conclusions will have implications for translation into a second language , especially english , around the world . ' translation into the second language ' is firmly grounded in empirical research , and in this regard it serves as a stimulus and a methodological guide for further research . it will be a valuable addition for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students of applied linguistics , translation theory , bilingualism and second language acquisition as well as those involved in teaching or practising translation at a professional level . stuart campbell associate professor in language studies , and director of the language acquisition research centre at the university of western sydney macarthur . further information on the books published in this series , and the table of contents for this title can be viewed at the longman linguistics on-line catalogue at : http : / / www . awl-he . com / linguistics for a complete listing of our world-wide offices , please click below : http : / / www . awl-he . com / offices available for review 	0

"Subject: sampson : educating eve  g . sampson , ( 1997 ) educating eve : the language instinct debate , cassell , london , 184pp . reviewed by feargal murphy , university college dublin . the rise of generative linguistics in 60s gave a new lease of life to the old nature vs . nurture debate . the behaviourist model of language was judged a failure at explaining the process of language acquisition and a new theory of language acquisition emerged . it was rooted in the philosophy of descartes in the 17th century as well as humboldt and , ultimately , plato . it came to be known as linguistic nativism or rationalist linguistics and is most associated with noam chomsky . the central tenet of this theory is that children are born with some kind of language acquisition device already in place in their brains which allows them to acquire the language of their environment . within linguistic nativism there has been some debate as to whether this device provides merely general rules that allow for the acquisition of language or whether it is a rich innate system that provides a complete basis for language acquisition so that a child can acquire the complexities of a language at a time when its general cognitive development could not possibly cope with such complexity . the rationalist tradition behind linguistic nativism has always been in contrast with empiricism which states that all ideas and knowledge ( including knowledge of language ) come from experience obtained through the senses and that there can be no innate knowledge . a view that goes back to the 17th century and the writings of locke , berkeley and hume and in the modern era has also been associated with the philosophers of the vienna circle and karl popper . _ educating eve _ will certainly not determine the outcome of the nature vs . nurture debate , nor will it , in my opinion , lead to any productive insight into the debate . the book fails to understand the scope and import of the nativist arguments and consequently falls short of presenting a genuine criticism of it . as it stands the book will be applauded by those who are already favourably disposed towards its conclusions and derided by those who are not . _ educating eve _ ( henceforth _ ee _ ) argues against the writings of chomsky , as well as pinker 's ' the language instinct ' , bickerton 's ' language and species ' and jackendoff 's ' patterns in the mind ' . these three books are essentially aimed at the general rather than the specialist reader . the result of targeting these three books is to make the arguments against nativism appear weak and superficial . the desire to rescue public opinion from the wrong path is a recurring theme in the author 's work . in his _ language and liberty _ , which also argued for a non-nativist view of language , the main aim was to discourage people from following left wing politics . the author 's politics , unfortunately , emerge as a strong force in this book . given the importance of the nativism debate i shall focus primarily on the more important linguistic issues , leaving aside politics except when they cloud the issues surrounding nativism the alternative to nativism that this book argues for is essentially a version of karl popper 's empiricism . according to this view the ability to learn may be innate but there are no domain specific innate mechanisms involved in learning . people learn the language of the community they belong to in the same way that they learn anything else , by trial and error . they ' make original though fallible conjectures and test them against objective reality ' ( p . 137 - all quotes are from _ ee _ unless otherwise indicated ) . eventually , using this method , each individual comes to learn a language . what they learn are ' wholly cultural constructs ' ( p . 137 ) , an e - language rather than an i - language , to use chomsky 's terminology . note that the conception of language in _ ee _ is totally different from those of chomsky , jackendoff , bickerton or pinker . for these nativists , language cannot belong to a society rather than to the individual . this issue is not actually addressed in the book . _ ee _ merely states that language is a cultural artifact and not biological , but does not furnish any evidence for this claim . the book also states popper 's belief that the mind is not amenable to scientific theorising ( p . 138 ) . i am unable to find any evidence in the book to support this claim . however , if one assumes that the mind is outside the domain of scientific inquiry then it simply becomes impossible to engage in a debate about the merits of the specifics of any nativist theory . the first task this book undertakes is to demolish chomsky 's arguments for nativism ( only sourcing material up to 1991 ) and then to demolish the 's econd wave ' nativists - with pinker foremost in the second wave . the book utilises many arguments , some more noteworthy than others , and it would be beyond the scope of this review to examine them all . i will look at a few of the arguments , more or less at random . the arguments against chomsky centre on what sampson perceives as the basis of nativism : 1 : speed of acquisition 2 : age - dependence 3 : poverty of data 4 : convergence among grammars 5 : language universals 6 : species - specificity _ ee _ claims the first argument ( speed of acquisition ) is hollow as there is no way of determining what exactly 's peed ' could be in this area . however , it seems uncontroversial enough that children acquire language faster than adults and that they do so without the problems that adults encounter . there is no attempt in the book to address the notion of whether different languages are acquired at different speeds or whether different children acquiring the same language do so in radically different sequences . this would seem to be a distinct possibility if we do not have an innate language specific faculty but rather rely on some generalised learning mechanism . a look at the evidence regarding language acquisition across languages would have helped make the case conclusive . the book should have dealt more with data available in order to show that only a non-nativist account of language acquisition could capture the facts . instead _ ee _ relies on the notion that the popperian account can cope just as well as a nativist account and is closer to the ' common sense ' view of language . but this does not prove that a popperian account is right . chomsky 's second argument ( age - dependence ) is dismissed because , the book states , humans can learn language at any age "" if they see the task as worthwhile "" ( p . 36 ) . however , the author does not describe any procedure for assessing the worthwhileness of the task . why a child would find it worthwhile to learn a language when its needs are being met by compliant adults responding to non-linguistic communication is not addressed . if the early vocalisations of children are evidence of the beginnings of language acquisition , then the child is deciding at a very early age that language is ' worthwhile ' , at a stage when it seems difficult to believe the child is weighing up any options to see what may or may not be worthwhile . following this logic we could extend the criterion of "" worthwhileness "" to other ' learning ' such as ' learning to walk ' and eliminate the innate component from that as well . the book states that there are "" plenty of cases on record of adults mastering a second language to native-speaker standard apart from accent "" ( p . 36 ) ; i am not quite sure what it might mean to achieve native-speaker standard apart from accent . what the book suggests - without providing any crucial evidence - - is that "" learning as a general process is for biological reasons far more rapid before puberty than after "" ( p . 37 ) . this is supposed to show that age dependence is not proof of a critical period for language acquisition using some innate language acquisition device - - a critical period being one of the features that is characteristic of innate behaviour . the age dependence , according to the book , falls out from the slowing down of the learning process in general after puberty . this , however , seems to contradict the other argument against age dependence ; that an adult can master a second language to native speaker standard . the author also states that "" susan curtiss herself regarded genie as refuting the strong version of lenneberg 's claim , that natural language acquisition cannot occur after puberty "" ( p . 37 ) . susan curtiss might want to respond to that one herself . my understanding of her work on genie is that genie did have language ( that is , rule-governed creative linguistic behaviour ) but was not able to achieve anything close to native speaker competence while under observation ( curtiss , p . 204 ) even though it would indeed have been ' worthwhile ' to do so . furthermore her linguistic development did not follow the same course as children acquiring language normally . this suggests that genie 's ability to learn language was diminished due to her age but the important point is that her cognitive development in other areas seemed not to be so affected . it would also have been worthwhile for chelsea to have learned language , yet chelsea did not achieve native speaker standard ( see jackendoff 's _ patterns in the mind _ ) . the third argument presented by chomsky for nativism , according to the book , is poverty of data during acquisition . the arguments against chomsky presented in the book do not bear close scrutiny . according to the book , motherese provides a "" graded series of language lessons "" ( p . 39 ) and is not at all degenerate , as the poverty of data argument states . this is not particularly new ( the references cited by the author are from the early 70s ) . the fact is , however , that we really do not yet know what role - if any - motherese plays in learning / acquiring a language . but one thing worth noting is that there is no language teaching theory that proposes that adults could be most effectively taught a second language through being taught in motherese . it is also true that there do not yet exist conclusive studies on the universality of motherese ( although the wide variety of language groups studied show a high degree of similarity ) . in some cultures motherese seems to play less of a role and is different to the motherese we see in the english speaking world . in fact motherese or child directed speech seems not to make the task of learning / acquiring language all that much easier but what it does is allow for a high degree of socialisation . this can be seen in the fact that the simplification of structure decreased greatly when the parent and child were no longer in the presence of the observer but merely being taped . the motherese wa s not for the benefit of the child only . of course , if language is not in any way innate we are left with the problem of explaining how child directed speech is so perfectly a "" graded series of language lessons "" for the infant , despite the fact that adults are not taught how to give language lessons , perhaps empiricist would have to say that the ability to give "" a graded series of lessons "" in language is innate . the author states that a popperian account of language learning would allow for a child to determine the general principles from the input ( as it would for an adult who wants to learn a language ) . this is important as the nativist account holds that the basic principles of language are innate and thus are available for use in determining what is going on in the language input . individuals learning a language via a popperian method would use their learning abilities to work out the general principles from the input without any of these principles being already available in the head . but what are we to make of cases of * specific language impairment * where the rate of learning / acquisition a language seems different from other areas of learning ? the whole basis of a popperian analysis is that language acquisition is not different from any other domain where learning occurs . consequently , it predicts that there could be no difference between the acquisition of language and learning in other cognitive domains . this prediction runs counter to reported facts as clearly presented in yamada 's 1990 book ' laura : a case study for the modularity of language ' . in arguing against chomsky , the author takes chomsky 's much used example of english speaking children determining how to ask yes / no questions . he is seeking to show that chomsky is being dishonest in his analysis by not verifying the data . a child working out how to make a yes / no question in english has to work out that if any verb is to be moved it has to be the verb in the main clause and not just the first verb encountered in the sentence . to work this out , a child has to distinguish between verbs and other words and also between main verbs and auxiliary verbs as well as knowing the structure of the phrases in the sentence . then the child has to work out that auxiliary verbs in the main clause can move to the beginning of the sentence but that main verbs appear in the infinitive while a tensed 'd o ' occurs at the beginning of the sentence . chomsky 's point is that children learn to make these distinctions and move the appropriate verb from the appropriate position to form a yes / no question with great ease . both the author and chomsky agree on the analysis of the rule involved in forming a yes / no question but where they differ is in their belief about the * exposure * of children to yes / no questions where the main clause is not the first clause in the sentence but rather a subordinate clause appears first , as in : is the man who is talking to bill wearing gloves ? chomsky 's claim is that a child may not encounter such a question in the language s / he hears before determining the rule of yes / no question formation . _ ee _ argues that such sentences are indeed present in the language that children hear . what the book actually has to prove is that all children hear this crucial form of yes / no question before they determine the yes / no question formation rule . this is not shown but instead it is argued that such structures are available to children who read ; but children who do n't read learn language as well . indeed it is quite possible that children form the rule about yes / no question formation before the ever learn to read . the author claims that he shows that chomsky is ' wildly mistaken ' ( p . 42 ) , he paraphrases the situation as follows : "" . . the man who is the world 's leading living intellectual , according the cambridge university a second plato is basing his radical reassessment of human nature largely on the claim that a certain thing never happens ; he tells us that it strains his credulity to think that it might happen , but he has never looked , and people who have looked find that it happens a lot . "" ( p . 42-43 ) the people who have looked are sampson himself and geoff pullum ( p . 42 ) but they have only checked sources of written language but as i have said this ignores the fact that illiterate children can also speak . in fact , so enamoured is the author with the written word that he argues that , historically , hypotaxis emerges as literacy develops . somehow the organisation involved in writing leads to great leaps forward in language . he does finally admit that there is no great research on this topic but blames linguistics departments for this ( "" this is not a popular topic of research in linguistics departments "" , p . 75 ) . there is nothing to prevent the taping of the speakers of modern pre-literate languages - if one can find any cultures that could be classed as pre-literate without any qualifications - in order to test for the occurrence of hypotaxis but the author does n't seem to have u ndertaken this task . the book does n't opt fully for the idea that there was little or no hypotaxis in the languages of ancient pre-literate cultures as the author states , hedging his bets : "" if there was little or no hypotaxis in these languages "" [ the hebrew of the old testament etc . ] "" that is a real difference between them and more recent languages "" . ( p . 75 ) for obvious reasons we can never answer the question of whether or not there was hypotaxis in hebrew before writing or indeed while writing was still a fairly recent innovation . it is true that serious investigation into parataxis and subordination in various languages has been carried out and goes back over one hundred years . the book claims that "" it was a cliche of late nineteenth century linguistics that the early stages of languages with a long recorded history showed a development from what was called parataxis to hypotaxis "" ( p . 74 ) . it cites great linguists like karl brugmann , hermann paul and eduard hermann as support for the notion that languages go from a paratactic stage to a hypotactic stage . but there are two problems with this . firstly , not all nineteenth century linguists would have been happy with the notion that hypotaxis emerged as writing developed . hermann jacobi 's 1897 work ' composition und nebensatz ' concluded that "" maori , like early stages of pie may not have had contained a relative particle "" in subordination ( lehmann , p . 60 ) . so jacobi is claiming that pie did have subordination which is the basis of hypotaxis for brugmann , paul and hermann . secondly , there is really no reason to believe that nineteenth century linguists got everything right in comparative and historical linguistics . the idea that hypotaxis emerged from a previous stage must be seen alongside other ideas in nineteenth century linguistics about the development of languages from primitive systems to more complex systems . the fourth argument the book looks at is convergence among grammars - the notion that people of varying levels of intelligence and exposure to different language inputs , converge on the same grammar . the book claims ( p . 46 ) that chomsky has admitted that educated people may know their mother tongue better . this does not fit in with an i - language approach and so is obviously not representative of chomsky 's theory of language . an i - language approach excludes the possibility of a mother tongue ( an e - language ) that people have mastered to varying degrees . for chomsky such things as english or hungarian or swahili do not exist in any meaningful way . this is controversial , but the point is that for chomsky there is no mother tongue divorced from an individual 's knowledge of it . the second line of argument identified by sampson is that people do not actually converge on the same grammar as they give different grammatical judgments in response to the same data . the book refers to labov 's work - presented in austerlitz ( 1974 ) - where respondents varied in their judgments about the grammaticality of presented sentences . the really interesting thing here is that the people taking the test understood the instructions - oral and written - which they were given concerning the test . it is hard to see how they could all have the same understanding of what was said to them unless they had pretty much the same grammars . the language that was used in their instructions would most likely have contained a variety of syntactic constructions , but there are no reports of the people completing the test remarking on the ungrammaticality of any of the instructions they were given . it is easy to find people varying in groups and even as individuals over time when you ask them to assess sentences such as : ' every one of the boys did n't go there ' . the fact that individuals will differ in their judgment over time shows that what is being tested is not the individual 's competence because an adult 's competence does not vary - although their performance might . a large number of factors determine whether an individual would judge a sentence like the one given above as perfectly grammatical or borderline or totally ungrammatical . but the fact that there is a variation in the reported judgments does not in fact constitute an argument against convergence among grammars it is not a test of grammars but rather a test of performance . intuitions about sentences involving scope relations of quantifiers and negation vary because of the many factors that bear on performance . the book also contends ( pp . 107 - 137 ) that the existence of language universals can be explained by the fact that a popperian learning system will automatically yield such universals . they are not the result of the nature of the language faculty but instead derive from the popperian system of learning . again , the author does not show that a popperian account is better than a nativist account at capturing the facts . if the case against nativism is to be proven , then those language universals that we can agree to exist must be explicable either within a popperian system * only * or at least they should be explained better by a popperian learning theory . the book does not do this . the book targets pinker 's ' the language instinct ' . why sampson decides to devote so much effort to the book is somewhat puzzling . pinker 's book is aimed at a fairly general audience and as such is not really a worthwhile target . among the arguments against pinker we find the assumption that surnames are actual words in individual languages . this means that the existence of a person in england with 's ri ' as the first three letters in his surname means that 's ri ' is a possible initial consonant cluster in english ( p . 83 ) . the author also can't resist taking a pot-shot at what he imagines pinker 's political views to be . the tone of his response to pinker is one of condescension which can be irritating and detracts from any points that the author may be trying to make as well as being irrelevant to the substantive issues . but the worst attack is saved for bickerton . the book seeks to portray him as an intellectual lightweight in a most unappealing way ( p . 76 ) : "" [ bickerton 's ] stuff must be a real hit with green students on hawaii "" . it is surely not too much to expect that personal abuse would be kept out of the realm of intellectual debate . the book also takes on jackendoff stating that jackendoff writes well : "" jackendoff is one of the best writers among the linguistic nativists "" ( p . 76 ) , but not forgiving him for being a nativist . "" if jackendoff reaches for the word ' instinct ' so hastily in these cases , how can we trust him to use the word judiciously where there are real questions to be resolved "" ( p . 79 ) . the main issue picked up on in jackendoff 's work relates to sign language . at one stage the author says ( arguing against jackendoff 's analysis of universal grammar ) : "" jackendoff has shortly beforehand pointed out that one aspect of american sign language grammar is not paralleled in any spoken language . the sign-language equivalent of the third person pronouns ( she , they , his ) consists of gesturing ( with hand shapes and movements that depend on whether the reference is singular , plural or possessive ) to locations in the signing space which have been assigned to successive topics of conversations . ' the effect is that there are as many different third-person pronouns available as there are discernible locations in the signing space ' . no spoken language has a pronoun system remotely like this , so how can it be part of our innate knowledge . "" ( p . 78 ) the author is missing the point here . sign language expresses person , number , gender and possession as spoken language does and not some other features not found in spoken language . so the system the same as spoken language . the use of pronouns in sign language is exactly the same as the use of pronouns in spoken language and is based on universal grammar , what is different is the modality . the availability of the signing space means that a signer can introduce a greater number of pronouns into the discourse as each pronoun can be allocated a location in the signing space without leading to any confusion . this is the same as the fact that i could use as many second person singular pronouns as i wanted as long as i looked at the individual that i was addressing with that pronoun . looking at the person that i was referring to with the pronoun is really the same as the signer using the sign space to tag pronouns . this is not just true of second person pronouns . i could be talking about , say , the members of a football team and refer to each individual using a third person pronoun . i could be quite clear in my own head who is being picked out each time , it would just be confusing to the person i was talking to . this is because there would be no way for them to distinguish the referents of each of the pronouns . in sign language i can exploit the possibility of the signing space by tagging each meaning of a pronoun with a location in space so that the whole thing does not get confusing . the potential in both oral and sign language is the same , but sign can exploit the signing space in a way that oral language cannot . the point is that the limitations are not imposed by language but by the modality . what jackendoff is saying is that the same universal grammar underlies language no matter what the modality . the last chapter in the book ( ' the creative mind ' ) presents sampson 's view of popper . it is not without problems and the author devotes much time to arguing that popper did n't always mean what he said and that sampson 's analysis of popper is the best . however , the crucial lines in the chapter for the purposes of nature vs . nurture are : "" minds are not a topic open to scientific theorising . "" ( p . 139 ) and "" the position adopted in this book is that conscious human minds are not physical entities . talking about minds is not a way of talking about high-level aspects of brain functioning . minds and bodies are different and separate things which act on one another . "" ( p . 138 ) for all those people who believe that minds are indeed a topic open to scientific theorising this will render anything else the book has to say suspect . modern nativists ( as well as most non-nativists ) view the mind as amenable to scientific theorising . for chomsky there is no other possible way to study the mind ( chomsky 1993 , 1995 ) . it is hard to see how a significant debate can take place between two such opposite points of view . the author is committed to the cause of a popperian analysis of language learning / acquisition but will never be able to convert a nativist to his way of thinking until he can gain an understanding of the motivations for adopting a nativist position or reconcile himself with the possibility that nativism may be a stance that an intelligent person can adopt . the author seems to imagine himself fighting a rear guard action against the hordes of misguided nativists who , as he sees it , are close to winning the hearts and minds of the masses . one important aspect of this book is that it can be read as a means of testing how one feels about linguistic nativism . unfortunately for sampson 's crusade , it had the effect of making me prefer the nativist analysis even more than before .

"Subject: review massaro 1998  massaro , d . w . ( 1998 ) . perceiving talking faces : from speech perception to a behavioral principle ( mit press , cambridge , mass . ) . 552 pp . , 212 illus . , 1 cd-rom . $ 55 . 00 . reviewed byl noel nguyen , laboratory for psycholinguistics , fpse , university of geneva , switzerland ( nnguyen @ fapse . unige . ch ) . 1 synopsis 1 . 1 general outline this book is concerned with how multiple sources of information are processed in speech perception and , more generally , in pattern recognition . it is based upon an important research programme conducted by massaro and his colleagues over the last two decades . the book focuses on the perception of so-called bimodal speech , addressing a wide range of issues about the way in which visual information ( as provided by the speaker 's face ) and auditory information are combined with each other by the perceptual system . the scope of the book is much larger , however , as massaro 's purpose here is to describe and defend a new psychological law relevant to a wide variety of domains . in contrast to already well-established laws of the same kind ( e . g . weber 's law of perception ) , which are all unidimensional , the new principle is multidimensional , in that it describes how several factors impact behaviour . this principle is embodied in a computational model of pattern recognition , the fuzzy logical model of perception ( flmp ) , whose latest version is presented and discussed in detail . the flmp is systematically contrasted with alternative computational models , using a broad perceptual database as benchmark throughout the book . in a separate part , the book also deals with methods for synthesizing talking faces in experiments on bimodal speech perception , and introduces baldi , the talking face developed by massaro and his coworkers . the book is accompanied by a cd-rom which contains a series of demonstrations relating to many of the topics dealt with . the book is divided into four main sections . section 1 , "" perceiving talking faces "" , focuses on the perception of speech by ear and eye . massaro reviews the most significant empirical findings in that domain , discusses the main methodological issues , and presents a general classification of the existing computational models of bimodal speech perception . central to this section is the idea that speech perception obeys a general behavioural principle of integration between different sources of information . section 2 , "" broadening the domain "" , aims at assessing how well this principle holds up across broad individual and situational variability . the author demonstrates that inter-individual variations in how bimodal speech is perceived , depending on the listener 's age or native language for instance , can be accounted for within the flmp framework . using examples taken from different perceptual and cognitive situations , massaro also defends the idea that the flmp adequately describes information processing irrespective of these situational differences . section 3 , "" broadening the framework "" , opens with a presentation of an extended and more explicit version of the flmp , designed in particular to account for the dynamics of speech processing . the section also includes a detailed analysis of the methodological issues involved in assessing quantitative predictions in psychology , along with a discussion of the critiques expressed by other investigators about the flmp over the years . finally , section 4 , "" creating talking faces "" , is specifically dedicated to the synthesis of visual speech . 1 . 2 the new behavioural principle although many readers may already be familiar with massaro 's fuzzy logical model of perception , i shall here assume the contrary , and proceed to present a brief outline of the model . a central assumption of the flmp is that pattern recognition involves a common set of processes regardless of the specific nature of the patterns . speech is not seen as being associated with a dedicated processing module , as in the motor theory of speech perception ( liberman , 1996 ) for instance . on the contrary , the sensory information is assumed to be processed in the same way whether our brain is busy recognizing speech sounds , letters , or manual gestures , to take but a few examples . in any of these cases , the flmp postulates that mapping a stimulus into a unique perceptual category entails going through three main stages of processing , the feature evaluation stage , the feature integration stage , and the decision stage . the evaluation stage consists of converting the available sources of information into a set of properties referred to as features . each feature is given a continuous ( fuzzy truth ) value , and represents the degree to which the stimulus corresponds to each of a set of internal prototypical patterns , along a particular perceptual dimension . thus , one important visual feature in the perception of cv syllables is the degree of opening of the lips . the model therefore assumes that the internal prototypes available to the perceptual system will specify that the lips are open at the onset of the syllable for / da / , closed for / ba / , etc . in a second stage , the features are integrated with each other , so as to determine the overall degree of match of the sensory input with each of the prototypes ( e . g . each of the syllables known to the receiver ) . in the third and final stage , a decision is taken , on the basis of the relative goodness of match of the input with each prototype . the flmp makes a number of specific assumptions at each stage in this process . first , it hypothesizes that all of the available sources of information are simultaneously brought into play in pattern recognition . thus , visible speech and auditory speech are both assumed to have an influence on how bimodal speech is perceived . second , different sources of information are assumed to be evaluated independently of each other . this means for example that visible speech does not have any effect on how auditory speech is converted into a set of features , the two sources of information being combined at a later stage of processing only . the model also makes specific assumptions about how sources of information are integrated with each other ( multiplicative rule ) , and about how decisions are taken ( relative goodness rule ) . a major prediction of the model is that "" the influence of one source of information is greatest when the other source is neutral or ambiguous "" ( 19 ) . this prediction is best illustrated by an experiment whose results served as a database for testing models of pattern recognition on several occasions in the book ( chapters 2 and 11 ) . in this experiment , synthetic auditory stimuli ranging on a continuum between / ba / and / da / were crossed with visual stimuli also varying between / ba / and / da / . the bimodal stimuli were presented to subjects in a forced-choice identification task , along with each of the unimodal stimuli . ( this expanded factorial design is shown by massaro to be the most appropriate experimental design for determining how two sources of information are combined with each other in pattern recognition . ) for the bimodal stimuli , the main results are typically depicted as a two-factor plot , with the proportion of / da / responses on the ordinate , the levels of the auditory source of information on the abscissa , and a different curve for each of the levels of the visual source of information . when represented in that way , the results clearly show a statistical interaction between the two sources of information . specifically , the influence of one source of information proves to be larger in the middle , ambiguous range of the other source . this interaction graphically takes the shape of an american football , which is for this reason presented throughout the book as the hallmark of the the fuzzy logical model of perception . in summary , massaro proposes a universal principle of perceptual cognitive performance to explain pattern recognition . according to this principle , "" people are influenced by multiple sources of information in a diverse set of situations . in many cases , these sources of information are ambiguous and any particular source alone does not usually specify the appropriate interpretation . the perceiver appears to evaluate the multiple sources of information in parallel for the degree to which each supports various interpretations , integrate them together to derive the overall support for each interpretation , assess the support of each alternative based on all of the alternatives , and select the most appropriate response . "" ( p . 291 ) . 2 critical evaluation 2 . 1 general evaluation this book is clearly a major contribution to the study of speech perception and , more generally , to cognitive psychology . it is admirably clear and is written in quite an elegant manner . i do not doubt that the book will be read with great interest by research scientists from many different fields . this work is the result of an ambitious intellectual endeavour aimed at introducing a new behavioural law , which is placed by massaro on an equal footing with weber 's law of perception , or the power law of learning . speech scientists are presented with an extensive series of experiments on the perception of bimodal speech . whatever stance they take in that domain , they should find quite challenging massaro 's view that speech perception constitutes but one aspect of a much more general form of cognitive processing , namely pattern recognition . computer scientists working in the field of speech technology should be particularly interested in the book 's final section about the synthesis of visual speech . regardless of their background , readers should also find the book worth using as a tutorial on the experimental methods available for investigating speech perception . a great variety of experimental paradigms and tasks are discussed at length by massaro , who also extensively discusses the methods for assessing computational models of pattern recognition and , in particular , for fitting these models to observed results . in that respect , using the results of the experiment described above as a reference database was quite a good initiative in my view , as this allows the reader more easily to understand massaro 's point as new issues are raised , without having again to go through the details of the experimental design each time . the book should also prove an invaluable resource for teaching . care was taken to select prototypical results , as well as to set this work in its historical context . a number of rather fascinating anecdotes and historical references are given , going from mcgurk 's personal account of the discovery of the mcgurk effect , to an audio-visual rendition of the introduction to george miller 's seminal article on the ubiquitousness of the number 7 plus or minus 2 , with miller 's face texture-mapped onto baldi 's wire-frame head . the cd-rom that accompanies the book enables the reader directly to experience the psychological illusions associated with the perception of bimodal speech , and constitutes as such a most useful research and teaching tool . on the negative side , massaro 's use of the / ba / - / da / experiment as a leading strand throughout obviously results in the book being focused on the perception of non-sense syllables . although the interaction of visible speech and audible speech in word recognition is mentioned on a number of occasions ( e . g . pp 21-23 and pp . 181-182 ) , the book contains few suggestions as to how we perceive isolated words , let alone connected speech . i also was surprised by the fact that little place was devoted to presenting other current theories and models of speech perception . although models such as trace are mentioned on several occasions in the book , i think it is fair to say that the flmp is still given the lion 's share . the book also has some minor defects such as the absence of a list of figures , and the fact that some of the cd-rom bands ( 1 . 4 , 1 . 5 and 1 . 6 ) are referred to incorrectly in the text . the list of the cd-rom selections should have pointed to the pages where each band is referred to . in another domain , it would have been quite interesting to have the perceptual database used in the book made available on the cd-rom . although this would have probably required a substantial amount of additional work , i should also have found it useful to be provided with an interactive version of the main computational models discussed in the book ( flmp , the race model , the single channel model , etc . ) . the flmp model can be downloaded from massaro 's laboratory web site at santa cruz ( http : / / mambo . ucsc . edu ) , but it is currently distributed in fortran code which has to be modified and recompiled for each new set of data , an operation which is probably out of reach of many students in psychology or linguistics . 2 . 2 specific comments i am not familiar with all of the areas dealt with in this book , and will not hide the fact that this review is biased towards my own interests , namely the production and perception of auditory speech . the following comments more specifically concentrate on two issues relating to this area of research , the role of features in speech processing and the time course of speech processing . 2 . 2 . 1 features most useful are the extensive comments made by massaro about the status of features in his model ( see in particular chapter 2 and chapter 10 ) . i long have found it difficult to determine how close these features were to classical phonetic features . the book makes it clear to me that there is no direct relation between the former and the latter . as indicated above , the flmp postulates that there are three main stages of processing in pattern recognition : the feature evaluation stage , the feature integration stage , and the decision stage . specific assumptions are made in the model about how features are integrated with each other , and how a decision is taken depending on the outcome of this integration . from a set of feature values , therefore , the model will predict the probability of occurrence of each possible response ( e . g . "" ba "" and "" da "" ) . however , attention should be paid to the fact that these feature values are in no way derived from the stimulus . they are actually determined in an posteriori manner , from the subjects ' observed responses , using an algorithm ( stepit ) which allows the deviation between these responses and the predicted ones to be minimal . features are seen in the model as * free parameters * , whose values are set on the basis of the actual performance of the subject in the pattern recognition task , so as to make the model perform at its best , i . e . to maximize its goodness of fit . according to massaro , "" [ the model is ] * predicting * the exact * form * of the results , but * postdicting * the actual quantitative * values * that make up the overall predictions "" ( p . 294 , his emphasis ) . in other words , the stimulus is on no occasion explicitly mapped onto the internal features of the flmp model . in that respect , features as defined in the flmp look markedly different from phonetic features . let us take for example the opposition between / ba / and / da / , on which much emphasis is put in the book . acoustically , / b / and / d / are said to differ from each other according to the feature grave-acute , / b / being classified as grave and / d / as acute . as is the case with flmp features , grave and acute can be viewed as target values referring to prototypical stops . however , the grave-acute feature is explicitly defined in acoustical terms ( e . g . slope of the short-term spectrum at the release of the stop , see stevens & blumstein , 1978 ) . on the contrary , the exact nature of the flmp features remains undetermined , their values being subject to one main constraint which is to make the model account for the subjects ' responses as accurately as possible . thus , the acoustic structure of the stimulus is not directly taken into consideration in the estimation of the feature values . in the experiments using audible speech , flmp features do lend themselves to an acoustic interpretation . in the / ba / - / da / experiment for example , the prototypes for / ba / and / da / are assumed to include one auditory feature , namely the variations in frequency of the second ( f2 ) and third ( f3 ) formants at the onset of the vowel ( slightly falling f2-f3 for / da / , rising f2-f3 for / ba / ) . however , this interpretation stems from the fact that f2 and f3 onset frequencies were precisely the acoustic parameters manipulated by the experimenters to synthesize the auditory continuum between / ba / and / da / . in other words , the acoustic significance of the flmp features is derived from the way in which the experiment has been designed . the model does rely on a particular system of acoustic features ( see for example stevens & blumstein , 1978 , for an alternative system ) , but this system is embodied in the experimental design , and is as such external to the model itself . in practice , therefore , the issue of how speech sounds are mapped onto features is not addressed in the model . why this is so is not clear to me . on several occasions , massaro suggests that determining in advance how a given individual will convert a given stimulus into a set of feature values is simply out of our reach . this stimulus-to - feature mapping shows a variability which is said to be analogous to the variability of the weather : there are just too many previous contributions and influences to allow quantitative prediction ( 135 ) . a fundamental distinction is in fact established in the flmp between the intake of * information * , i . e . the stimulus-to - feature mapping , and * information processing * , i . e . how features are combined with each other and mapped into a response ( cf . p . 135 ) . while the flmp predicts that the information will be processed in the same way from one individual to the other , regardless of whether it relates to speech sounds , facial movements , manual gestures , etc . , it is assumed that the way in which this information is extracted from the stimulus is on the contrary subject to too many sources of variations to be accurately characterized ahead of time . in my understanding , this means that the so-called evaluation stage cannot be accounted for by the model , or at least not with much accuracy . however , at least on one occasion massaro does suggest that this limitation is not consubstantial with every model of perception and pattern recognition , and could be circumvented in some way . according to him , one could indeed "" easily hypothesize functions relating the feature values to the stimulus levels , [ although ] that would represent a * model of information * in addition to one of information processing "" ( 294 , my emphasis ) . this suggests that building such a model of information is feasible . whether there is a possibility of the flmp being completed with a model of this kind , i . e . an explicit stimulus-to - feature mapping stage , is an issue which remains to be addressed . 2 . 2 . 2 the time course of speech processing time plays quite a central role in different ways in the book . first , massaro shows how the flmp can be explicitly formalized to account for the dynamics of perceptual processing ( chap . 9 ) . this formalization is presented in reply to criticisms expressed by a number of investigators ( e . g . mcclelland , 1991 ) , who have pointed out that the flmp accurately characterizes the asymptotic outcome of the perceptual system ( e . g . the probability for a particular response to occur ) , but has little to say about the time course of processing . the dynamic version of the flmp is intended to address these reactions . in this version , the stimulus-to - feature mapping is assumed to take a certain amount of time . during this interval , the information about the stimulus gradually accumulates , and becomes increasingly accurate . it is assumed that accuracy increases as a negatively accelerated function of processing time , so that more information is gleaned early than late in the processing of the stimulus . one further assumption is that "" integration of the separate features [ is ] updated continuously as the featural information is being evaluated . similarly , decision [ can ] occur at any time after the stimulus presentation "" ( 259 ) . thus , there is a partial temporal overlap between the different stages of processing , in the sense that one process can begin before a previous process is finished ( see also figure 2 . 1 , p . 41 ) . these assumptions about the time course of information processing are supported by a number of experiments concerned with the effect of backward masking in the recognition of pure tones , and in the recognition of letters . speech obviously raises a number of specific issues in that domain , however . unlike written words , speech is a temporal phenomenon , it is continuous ( i . e . there are no systematic acoustic boundaries between phonemes , syllables , or words ) and , furthermore , time per se serves as a source of information in speech , as pointed out by massaro ( e . g . vowel duration is a major cue to the voicing of the following obstruent , to take but one example ) . somewhat regrettably , few indications are given about how the model could be assessed in the speech domain ( see remarks p . 194 and p . 263 ) . in addition to discussing the dynamics of processing , massaro examines how the temporal relations between sources of information are dealt with in pattern recognition . chapter 3 focuses on our sensitivity to temporal asynchronies between visible and audible speech . in the experiments reported in this chapter , bimodal cv syllables with various degrees of onset asynchrony between the auditory synthetic speech and the visible synthetic speech were presented to subjects in a forced-choice identification task . the results show that integration between the two sources of information still occurs when these sources of information are made asynchronous , provided that the time shift does not exceed a certain duration . one major challenge for phoneticians and psycholinguists alike is to characterize the relationship between what could be called the * external * dynamics of speech , i . e . the temporal organization of the speech signal , and the * internal * time course of speech processing . both play a role in the perception of speech , and it is most difficult to tell apart their respective influences on the listener 's behaviour ( samuel , 1996 ) . for example , in a gating study investigating the role of vowel duration as a cue to the voicing of the post-vocalic stop in cvc syllables , warren and marslen - wilson ( 1988 ) found that the proportion of voiced-coda responses increased as the listeners were presented with increasingly long portions of the initial cv sequence . one obvious interpretation is that longer vowels were perceived as being associated with voiced coda rather than voiceless ones . in keeping with massaro 's dynamical flmp , however , it may also be assumed that evaluating the information provided by the vowel takes time , and that the evidence pointing to a voiced coda gradually accumulates as more processing time is made available to the listener , all other things being equal . thus , the above finding raises the issue of how to differentiate the effect of vowel duration per se on the listener 's response , from that of the internal dynamics of processing . although this issue is not directly addressed in the book , there is no doubt that the flmp would constitute a most appropriate framework for further investigations in this domain . 2 . 3 general conclusion this book provides us with quite an extensive review of the work carried out by the author and others on the use of multiple cues in speech perception and , more generally , pattern recognition . it is aimed at a very large audience , and constitutes a most useful tool both for teaching and research purposes . i do not doubt that it will soon become a major reference for researchers in phonetics , psycholinguistics , and cognitive psychology . 4 bibliography liberman , a . m .

- bridging the gap and enhance the trade-off between theoretical models of lexical knowledge and applications in nlp systems . these goals are justified : - by the increasingly central position that lexical knowledge , and in particular lexical semantics , is assuming within the general architecture of cognitive systems , both as a dynamic module which interact with other non-linguistic sources of knowledge , and as a component playing a major role in interfacing syntax and semantics ; - by the fact that lexical resources ( such as tagged corpora , computational dictionaries , machine readable dictionaries , wordnets ) are among the most crucial aspects of practical nlp systems . issues concerning the structure , the representation , the development , and the acquisition of lexical knowledge are thus of the uttermost importance when building nlp systems . lexical systems also play a crucial role in the design and construction of multilingual systems , a key feature at least for applications designed to operate in a distributed , non - centralized environment such as the world wide web . this second edition of wlss will focus on the portability and reusability of lexical systems , and on the issue of word sense disambiguation and semantic tagging . we also encourage the submission of papers concerning more general issues about linguistic lexical semantics and its interaction with computational lexicography . abstracts are invited for 30 - minute talks . here follows a non - exhaustive list of topics which could be addressed : * lexical resources for semantic tagging and word sense disambiguation . * use of lexicons and thesauruses to improve information retrieval / extraction techniques . * automatic acquisition and management of lexical resources . * reusability and tuning of existing lexical resources for novel tasks . * trade offs between generic and domain specific lexical resources . * multilingual lexical resources . * description and evaluation of existing tools and systems . * evaluation of different representation formats . * issues in computational lexical semantics and computational lexicography . * issues in the design , construction and use of lexical resources . * architecture for a cognitive plausible lexicon * lexical representation and the interface with syntactic processes * * change * * extended deadline for submissions * * change * * only electronic submissions are accepted . abstracts should not exceed 2 pages in length , in postscript or ascii format , and should be sent to the following address : wlss98 @ celi . sns . it . separate information should be sent , including the title of the talk , author 's name , address and affiliation . submissions must be limited to a maximum of one individual and one joint abstract per author . the deadline is : 20 january 1998 . the program committee intends to publish a selection of the papers presented at the conference . * * change * * important dates * * change * * submission of abstracts : 20 january 1998 notification of acceptance : 28 february 1998 conference : 6 - 7 april 1998 program committee pier marco bertinetto ( scuola normale superiore ) nicoletta calzolari ( ilc ) luca dini ( celi ) vittorio di tomaso ( celi ) alessandro lenci ( scuola normale superiore ) bernardo magnini ( irst ) fabio pianesi ( irst ) frederique segond ( xrce ) antonio zampolli ( ilc ) contact persons for every further information please contact the conference secretariat : vittorio di tomaso celi ditomaso @ sns . it alessandro lenci scuola normale superiore lenci @ alphalinguistica . sns . it scuola normale superiore laboratorio di linguistica piazza dei cavalieri 7 56126 pisa ( italy ) tel . + 39 50 509219 fax : + 39 50 563513 more information on the workshop and a copy of this call for papers is available on the web at the following address : http : / / celi . sns . it / ~ wlss98 	0

"Subject: workshop announcement  call for papers distributing and accessing linguistic resources workshop immediately before the first international conference on language resources and evaluation ( lrec ) , may 27 1998 granada , spain http : / / www . icp . grenet . fr / elra / conflre . html short description : this workshop will discuss ways to increase the efficacy of linguistic resource distribution and programmatic access , and work towards the definition of a new method for these tasks based on distributed processing and object-oriented modelling with deployment on the www . organizers : yorick wilks , hamish cunningham , wim peters , remi zajac workshop scope and aims - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - in general the reuse of of nlp data resources ( such as lexicons or corpora ) has exceeded that of algorithmic resources ( such as lemmatisers or parsers ) . however , there are still two barriers to data resource reuse : 1 ) each resource has its own representation syntax and corresponding programmatic access mode ( e . g . sql for celex , c or prolog for wordnet , sgml for the bnc ) ; 2 ) resources must generally be installed locally to be usable ( and of course precisely how this happens , what operating systems are supported etc . varies from case to case ) . the consequences of 1 ) are that although resources share some structure in common ( lexicons are organised around words , for example ) this commonality is wasted when it comes to using a new resource ( the developer has to learn everything afresh each time ) and that work which seeks to investigate or exploit commonalities between resources ( e . g . to link several lexicons to an ontology ) has to first build a layer of access routines on top of each resources . so , for example , if we wish to do task-based evaluation of lexicons by measuring the relative performance of an information extraction system with different instantiations of lexical resource , we might end up writing code to translate several different resources into sql or sgml . the consequence of 2 ) is that there is no way to "" try before you buy "" : no way to examine a data resource for its suitability for your needs before licencing it . correspondingly there is no way for a resource provider to expose limitted access to their products for advertising purposes , or gain revenue through piecemeal supply of sections of a resource . this workshop will discuss ways to overcome these barriers . the proposers will discuss a new method for distributing and accessing language resources involving the development of a common programmatic model of the various resources types , implemented in corba idl and / or java , along with a distributed server for non-local access . this model is being designed as part of the gate project ( general architecture for text engineering : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / research / groups / nlp / gate / ) and goes under the provisional title of an active creole server . ( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources ( e . g . connect wordnet to celex ) , what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . draft program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza louise guthrie roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum paper submission - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - formatting guidelines : papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . hard copies : three hard copies should be sent to : gill callaghan , fao yorick wilks dept . computer science university of sheffield regent court 211 portobello st . , sheffield s1 4dp uk electronic submission : electronic submission will be allowed in poscript or html . an ftp site will be available on demand . authors should send an info email to ( yorick wilks ) even if they submit in paper form . an electronic submission should be accompanied by a plain ascii text . # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of pages # files : name of file ( if also submitted electronically ) # note : anything you 'd like to add # keys : keywords # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper # . . . . . . important dates paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) february 15th 1998 paper notification april 1st camera - ready papers due may 1st dalr workshop may 27st "	0

verlag as volume 862 of the lectures notes in artificial intelligence , and the third international colloquium on grammatical inference , held at montpellier in france , the proceedings of which were published by springer - verlag as volume 1147 of the lecture notes in artificial intelligence . following the success of these events and the workshop on automata induction , grammatical inference , and language acquisition , held in conjunction with the international conference on machine learning at nashville in united states in july 1997 , the fourth international colloquium on grammatical inference will be held from july 12 through july 14 , 1998 , at iowa state university in united states . -

- e . g . , acquisition of grammar in conjunction with language semantics , semantic constraints on grammars , language acquisition by situated agents and robots , acquisition of language constructs that describe objects and events in space and time , developmental and evolutionary constraints on language acquisition , etc . * demonstrated or potential applications of grammar induction in natural language acquisition , computational biology , structural pattern recognition , information retrieval , text processing , adaptive intelligent agents , systems modelling and control , and other domains . -

Subject: the evaluation of parsing systems - workshop call for papers  the evaluation of parsing systems a workshop jointly organised by the cec language engineering 1 projects sparkle and ecran to be held at the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 26 may 1998 this workshop will provide a forum for researchers interested in the development and evaluation of natural language grammars and parsing systems , and in the creation of syntactically annotated reference corpora . organisers : john carroll , roberto basili , nicoletta calzolari , robert gaizauskas , gregory grefenstette workshop scope and aims the aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of evaluation methods for parsing systems , and proposals for the development of syntactically annotated language resources . with increased attention to evaluation of component technology in language engineering , evaluation of parsing systems is rapidly becoming a key issue . numerous methods have been proposed and while one , the parseval / penn treebank scheme , has gained wide usage , this has to some extent been due to the absence of workable alternatives rather than to whole-hearted support . parseval / ptb evaluation has several limitations and drawbacks , including a commitment to a particular style of grammatical analysis , and oversensitivity to certain innocuous types of misanalysis while failing to penalise other common types of more serious mistake . also , the original published description of the scheme - - and the evaluation software widely distributed as a follow-up to it - - is specific to the english language . it may be that there are currently no alternative more workable schemes or proposals , but this needs to be more fully discussed : this workshop will provide an opportunity for such a debate . this workshop is particularly timely given the large number of cec language engineering projects that involve parsing in one form or another and which need to evaluate and share the results of their efforts . parsing is an essential part of many larger applications , such as information extraction , which have gained in importance over the last few years . often in such systems , the strength of the parser and grammar has a direct effect on the desired results , and thus achieving good results rests on being able to determine and improve weaknesses in the parser / grammar . without a reliable parser evaluation method this cannot be done effectively . a parsing evaluation workshop is also appropriate at this time given the imminent creation of large-scale syntactically annotated resources for european languages . contributions from those involved in such activities are welcomed , so as to improve communication between the resource construction and the resource utilisation communities . this should ensure that the resources constructed are maximally useful to the general language engineering community . the organisation of this workshop brings together two european language engineering projects which are closely related and whose partners share similar research interests : sparkle and ecran . the organisers solicit contributions from the general community on the following topics : - descriptions of generic syntactic annotation schemes - methodologies and metrics for parsing system evaluation - reports and analyses of the results of utilising particular parser evaluation schemes - description / analysis / experience of language-dependent ( especially for languages other than english ) and task-dependent syntactic annotation schemes programme committee roberto basili gregory grefenstette ted briscoe mark hepple nicoletta calzolari tony mcenery john carroll maria teresa pazienza roberta catizone paola velardi robert gaizauskas yorick wilks paper submission papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . submission may be in either hard copy or electronic form . the submission deadline is february 15th , 1998 . hard copy submission : three copies of the paper should be sent to : dr john carroll cognitive and computing sciences university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh uk electronic submission : electronic submission may be in either self-contained latex , postscript , or rtf formats , to john . carroll @ cogs . susx . ac . uk . for each submission -

Subject: workshop on embodied conversational character  2nd call for papers the first workshop on embodied conversational characters granlibakken resort & conference center at lake tahoe tahoe city ( north shore ) california , usa october 12-15 , 1998 with the support of aaai cooperation of acm / sigchi recent advances in several core software technologies have made possible a new type of human-computer interface : the conversational character . conversational characters are autonomous , anthropomorphic , animated figures that have the ability to communicate through multiple modalities , including spoken language , facial expressions , and gestures . unlike textual natural language interfaces , conversational characters have the ability to perceive and produce the verbal and non-verbal signals that identify discourse structure and regulate the flow of information between interlocutors . such signals include intonational patterns , gestures , back-channel feedback signals , and turn-taking protocols . these capabilities enable them to engage in complex interactions with human users via natural speech rather than complex command languages , menus or graphical manipulations . research on conversational characters has emerged from a number of disciplines , including , among others , artificial intelligence , computational linguistics , computer animation , computer vision , psychology , cognitive science , virtual reality , cscw , and hci . this diversity is naturally reflected in the broad range of active research areas in conversational character interfaces . the primary goal of this workshop is to advance the state of conversational character research and development by identifying novel approaches to the topics and issues listed below , and integrating them into a framework for embodied , conversational human-computer interaction . selected contributors will be invited to expand and refine their papers for inclusion in a book to be published by addison - wesley . the aims of this book will be to introduce , define , and advance the field ; to give a snapshot of current work in it ; and to suggest future challenges and opportunities . particular topics of interest include , but are not limited to : * multi - modal interaction * autonomy * recognition & perception of speech , * behavior / dialogue planning gesture , facial expressions , etc . * distribution of semantic information * reactivity and opportunism across multiple modalities * rendering techniques * representation * semantic representations for * character individuation non-verbal communication * dialogue planning * affect and personality * turn - taking and back-channel signals * user studies * spoken language processing * tools for character * discourse structure building / authoring * intonation * architectures & applications papers should address one or more of these topics . demonstrations and video presentations of working systems are strongly encouraged . format the two and a half-day workshop will include several paper sessions , organized around emerging themes , with follow-up panel discussions . in addition , there will be a demonstration session for authors to present working systems . attendance attendance will be limited to 35-40 people . preference will be given to authors whose papers have been selected for presentation at the workshop . submission requirements paper submissions are due on june 15 , 1998 , and should be no longer than 6 pages ( 10-12 point font ) . upon acceptance , authors will be given the opportunity to expand their papers to 8-10 pages . electronic submissions in postscript or microsoft word formats are preferred , and should be sent to prevost @ pal . xerox . com . otherwise , send four hardcopies to : scott prevost attn : embodied conversational characters workshop fx palo alto laboratory 3400 hillview avenue , bldg . 4 palo alto , ca 94304 voice : 650 / 813-7701 deadlines submissions due june 15th notification of acceptance august 17th final papers due september 14th workshop october 12th - 15th workshop organizers joseph w . sullivan , fx palo alto lab , usa ( sullivan @ pal . xerox . com ) justine cassell , mit media laboratory , usa ( justine @ media . mit . edu ) workshop program committee committee co - chairs : scott prevost , fx palo alto lab , usa ( prevost @ pal . xerox . com ) elizabeth churchill , fx palo alto lab , usa ( churchill @ pal . xerox . com ) committee members : elisabeth andr , dfki gmbh , germany ( elisabeth . andre @ dfki . de ) gene ball , microsoft research , usa ( geneb @ microsoft . com ) phil cohen , oregon graduate institute , usa ( pcohen @ cse . ogi . edu ) barbara hayes - roth , stanford univ . , usa ( hayes-roth @ cs . stanford . edu ) kenji mase , atr international , japan ( mase @ mic . atr . co . jp ) clifford nass , stanford university , usa ( nass @ leland . stanford . edu ) mark steedman , university of pennsylvania , usa ( steedman @ cis . upenn . edu ) kris thorisson , lego a / s , denmark ( kris @ digi . lego . com ) demos chair : timothy bickmore , isii inc . , usa ( bickmore @ pal . xerox . com ) additional information for more information , please consult the workshop web page : www . fxpal . com / wecc98 / 	0

Subject: books on the history of linguistics  john benjamins publishing would like to call your attention to the following new titles in the history of linguistics : the emergence of semantics in four linguistic traditions hebrew , sanskrit , greek , arabic wout van bekkum , jan houben , ineke sluiter , kees versteegh 1997 ix , 322 pp . studies in the history of the language sciences , 82 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 617 2 price : us $ 99 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 4568 1 price : hfl . 198 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com the aim of this study is a comparative analysis of the role of semantics in the linguistic theory of four grammatical traditions , sanskrit , hebrew , greek , arabic . if one compares the organization of linguistic theory in various grammatical traditions , it soon turns out that there are marked differences in the way they define the place of 's emantics ' within the theory . in some traditions , semantics is formally excluded from linguistic theory , and linguists do not express any opinion as to the relationship between syntactic and semantic analysis . in other traditions , the whole basis of linguistic theory is semantically orientated , and syntactic features are always analysed as correlates of a semantic structure . however , even in those traditions , in which semantics falls explicitly or implicitly outside the scope of linguistics , there may be factors forcing linguists to occupy themselves with the semantic dimension of language . one important factor seems to be the presence of a corpus of revealed / sacred texts : the necessity to formulate hermeneutic rules for the interpretation of this corpus brings semantics in through the back door . the noblest animate motion speech , pysiology and medicine in pre-cartesian linguistic thought jeffrey wollock 1997 xlvi , 470 pp . studies in the history of the language sciences , 83 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 620 2 price : us $ 160 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 4571 1 price : hfl . 320 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com the body of theory on speech production and speech disorder developed prior to descartes has been so neglected by historians that its very existence is practically unknown today . yet it provides a framework for understanding the speech process which is not only comprehensive and coherent , but of great relevance to current debates on issues of language performance and applied linguistics . this is because , the author contends , current theoretical difficulties stem largely from initial errors of descartes ; whereas earlier theoretical formulations , while outlining a bio-mechanics of speech , retain the central role of the human agent . the discussions explicated in this book come mainly from the natural - philosophic and medical literature of greco - roman antiquity , the middle ages , and the renaissance and early 17th century . this uncharted territory is mapped for the first time by tracing its textual history and diffusion as well as explaining the theory on its own terms but in language that will be clear and comprehensible to non-specialists . interdisciplinary in perspective , the book encompasses topics of interest not only to the language sciences , but also to the biosciences , medicine , philosophy of human movement , psychology and behavioral sciences , neurosciences , speech pathology , experimental phonetics , speech and rhetoric , and the history of science in general . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - bernadette martinez - keck tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 publicity / marketing fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 john benjamins north america e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com 	0

2 ) resources must generally be installed locally to be usable ( and of course precisely how this happens , what operating systems are supported etc . varies from case to case ) . the consequences of 1 ) are that although resources share some structure in common ( lexicons are organised around words , for example ) this commonality is wasted when it comes to using a new resource ( the developer has to learn everything afresh each time ) and that work which seeks to investigate or exploit commonalities between resources ( e . g . to link several lexicons to an ontology ) has to first build a layer of access routines on top of each resources . so , for example , if we wish to do task-based evaluation of lexicons by measuring the relative performance of an information extraction system with different instantiations of lexical resource , we might end up writing code to translate several different resources into sql or sgml . the consequence of 2 ) is that there is no way to "" try before you buy "" : no way to examine a data resource for its suitability for your needs before licencing it . correspondingly there is no way for a resource provider to expose limitted access to their products for advertising purposes , or gain revenue through piecemeal supply of sections of a resource . this workshop will discuss ways to overcome these barriers . the proposers will discuss a new method for distributing and accessing language resources involving the development of a common programmatic model of the various resources types , implemented in corba idl and / or java , along with a distributed server for non-local access . this model is being designed as part of the gate project ( general architecture for text engineering : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / research / groups / nlp / gate / ) and goes under the provisional title of an active creole server . ( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum "	0

"Subject: 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation  invitation to become a member of the program committee for the 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation conference ( gecco-99 ) http : / / www-illigal . ge . uiuc . edu / gecco / greetings : the 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation conference ( gecco ) would like to invite recent authors of papers related to genetic and evolutionary computation ( gec ) to become members of the program committee of the gecco conference to be held on july 13-17 , 1999 in orlando , florida . as you may know , the 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation conference ( gecco ) will be a combined meeting of the eighth international conference on genetic algorithms ( icga ) and the fourth annual genetic programming conference ( gp ) in cooperation with the american association for artificial intelligence ( aaai ) , parallel problem solving from nature ( ppsn ) steering committee , the international conference on evolvable systems ( ices ) steering committee , and other organizations and conferences to be announced . gecco will be held in lieu of icga-99 and gp-99 , and as such , it combines the oldest continuously running gec conference , and the two largest gec conferences . we believe that the gecco conference in 1999 will be a unique opportunity to bring together an exceptionally large number of people from all facets of genetic and evolutionary computation . being on the program committee will involve reading , reviewing , and ranking about half a dozen submitted papers on genetic and evolutionary computation or related areas during the month of february 1999 . ( the paper submission deadline for gecco-99 is wednesday , january 27 , 1999 ) . the willingness of active contributors to help the conference in this way is absolutely critical to the success of gecco . in the past , some have complained that their point of view has been excluded from the review process . by agreeing to join us , active gec researchers will help make the gecco review process fair , open , and broadly participatory . as part of the charter establishing this conference , extraordinary steps have been taken to ensure that ( 1 ) review representation is exceptionally broad and ( 2 ) the traditions , norms , and standards of the different flavors of gec are respected . let us take a brief moment to explain how this will be done . first , the charter of the conference says that reviewers are automatically invited based on their recent contribution of a peer-reviewed publication : a person may be a reviewer for the conference if he or she is an author of at least one peer-reviewed paper in a journal , conference proceedings book , or collected book of papers published since january 1 , 1995 involving any aspect or combinations of aspects of [ genetic and ] evolutionary computation . thus , becoming a reviewer is even-handedly based on recency of peer-reviewed contribution . second , gecco explicitly recognizes and respects the different traditions of different sub-fields within gec and related disciplines . as such , the conference has established six different tracks each with its own chair / editor : 1 . evolution strategies / evolutionary programming ( es / ep ) . a . e . eiben , gusz @ wi . leidenuniv . nl 2 . genetic algorithms / classifier systems ( ga / cs ) . robert e . smith , rsmith @ btc . uwe . ac . uk 3 . genetic programming / evolvable hardware ( gp / eh ) . wolfgang banzhaf ( also proceedings editor - in - chief ) , banzhaf @ ls11 . informatik . uni-dortmund . de 4 . artificial life , adaptive behavior , and agents ( aaa ) . vasant honavar , honavar @ cs . iastate . edu 5 . dna and molecular computing ( dna / mc ) . max h . garzon , mgarzon @ memphis . edu 6 . real - world applications ( rwa ) . mark jakiela , mjj @ mecf . wustl . edu these separate "" demes "" will establish separate rules and standards for paper acceptance based on the practices within the sub-discipline . in this way , we hope to more closely group "" birds of a feather "" and thereby avoid the rejection of high quality papers by reviewers who are less than familiar with the standards that should apply to a particular kind of paper . with this kind of carefully constructed process , we believe that a large number of recent gec authors will choose to join the program committee . if you are willing to be a member ( reviewer ) of the program committee , please email gecco @ aaai . org ( note : please do not use a "" reply "" command to respond to this message since dave goldberg will be out of town for most of june ) and send the following information : ( 1 ) the exact way you want your name listed , ( 2 ) the institutional affiliation you want listed with your name , ( 3 ) your physical mailing address , ( 4 ) your phone number ( for courier address labels ) , ( 5 ) your preferred e-mail address , ( 6 ) which of the six committees you would like to join ( gp / eh , ga / cs , or es / ep , aaa , dna / mc , or rwa ) , and if you have a preference for one of the sub-categories within that committee ( gp and / or eh , ga and / or cs , es and / or ep , alife and / or adaptive behavior and / or agents , dna and / or mc ) . ( 7 ) the title , date , and publication name of a peer-reviewed gec or related paper ( published after january 1 , 1995 ) that qualifies you as a member of the gecco committee ( a complete citation is unnecessary ) . authors who choose to join the gecco program committee will be acknowledged in the conference proceedings as well as in various editions of the calls for papers , the conference brochure , and advertising . physical copies of the papers will be sent to reviewers by ups courier service in late january 1999 , and the review form will be sent by e-mail . reviewers will be given several weeks to read and review the papers . reviews are returned by e-mail directly to the aaai . the reviewer 's name is removed from the message by the aaai before the review is forwarded to the chair of the appropriate track and ( eventually ) the submitting author . if a reviewer 's physical mailing address or e-mail address changes between now and february 1999 , the conference office ( gecco @ aaai . org ) should be notified as soon as possible . although the conference is over a year away , we already have an outstanding lineup of chairs , editors , senior members , and tutorial speakers ( see http : / / www-illigal . ge . uiuc . edu / gecco / ) . the editors / chairs have already been mentioned , but among those joining us as senior committee members are thomas baeck , hans - georg beyer , michael conrad , ingo rechenberg , guenter rudolph , bir bhanu , bill p . buckles , runwei cheng , marco colombetti , herbert dawid , marco dorigo , emanuel falkenauer , mitsuo gen , randy l . haupt , sue ellen haupt , john h . holland , kim f . man , dirk c . mattfeld , zbigniew michalewicz , melanie mitchell , k . s . tang , michael d . vose , david andre , vladan babovic , forrest h bennett iii , tobias blickle , dimitris c . dracopoulos , frank d . francone , andreas geyer - schulz , wolfgang a . halang , hitoshi iba , christian jacob , martin keane , robert e . keller , john r . koza , sam kwong , w . b . langdon , peter nordin , and moshe sipper . among those joining us for an extensive offering of tutorials are rik belew , forrest h bennett iii , lawrence davis , kalyanmoy deb , ken dejong , stephanie forrest , max garzon , tetsuya higuchi , john r . koza , w . b . langdon , jean - arcady meyer , melanie mitchell , randy c . murphy , peter nordin , i . c . parmee , guenter rudolph , hans - paul schwefel , leigh tesfatsion , michael vose , darrell whitley , and stewart wilson . other workshop and tutorial proposals as well as ideas for invited speakers and other activities may be sent to the business committee ( deg @ uiuc . edu or koza @ cs . stanford . edu ) . as active researchers ourselves , we understand that it is difficult to take time away from research for the "" administrivia "" of the reviewing process . but researchers are often the first to complain when their conferences are guided by "" political "" not "" scientific "" considerations . therefore we ask that all qualified committee candidates take this invitation very seriously , and we urge you to step up to the plate to make sure that the technical content of this conference is guided by our field 's active contributors ( qualified reviewers should send an email with the requested information above to gecco @ aaai . org ; please do not use a "" reply "" command to answer this message ) . names of reviewers who respond before july 1 , 1999 will be published in the first call for papers . moreover , we issue a special invitation to past authors to consider submitting to gecco 99 . although gecco is a new entity it is the combine of the oldest and the two largest , high-quality conferences in the field of genetic and evolutionary computation . with six separate demes for different styles of work and a participatory review process , we expect an unusually author-friendly conference . additionally , past attendance at icga and gp suggests that we should have over 600 researchers in attendance , but we will take steps to make sure that there is plenty of time for face-to - face meeting and interaction as well . in short , we believe that gecco-99 will be a special event for the community of genetic and evolutionary computation . we hope you can take the time to join us in the review process and we welcome your paper submission , but in any event we look forward to seeing you in orlando , july 13-17 , 1999 at gecco-99 . thank you , david e . goldberg ( illinois ) gecco-99 conference chair and business committee and john r . koza ( stanford ) gecco-99 business committee note : again , please do not use a "" reply "" command to answer this message . instead , respond to gecco @ aaai . org for fastest handling .

"Subject: multimedia indexing and retrieval  acm sigir ' 98 post - conference workshop multimedia indexing and retrieval melbourne , australia , august 28 , 1998 call for participation background : this workshop will focus on the required functionality , techniques , and evaluation criteria for multimedia information retrieval systems . researchers have been investigating content-based retrieval from non-text sources such as images , audio and video . initially , the focus of these efforts were on content analysis and retrieval techniques tailored to a specific media ; more recently , researchers have started to combine attributes from various media . the goal of multimedia ir systems is to handle general queries such as "" find outdoor pictures or video of clinton and gore discussing environmental issues "" . answering such queries requires intelligent exploitation of both text / speech and visual content . multimedia ir is a very broad area covering both infrastructure issues ( e . g . efficient storage criteria , networking , client-server models ) and intelligent content analysis and retrieval . since this is a one-day workshop , we have chosen three focus areas in the intelligent analysis and retrieval area . about the workshop : the first focus of this workshop is on integrating information from various media sources in order to handle multimodal queries on large , diverse databases . an example of such a collection would be the www . in such cases , a query may be decomposed into a set of media queries , each involving a different indexing scheme . the interaction of various media sources that occur in the same context ( e . g . , text accompanying pictures , audio accompanying video ) is of special interest ; such interaction can be exploited in both the content analysis and retrieval phases . the second focus deals with examples of research using content and organization of multimedia information into semantic classes . users pose and expect a retrieval to provide answers to semantic questions . in practice this is difficult to achieve . building structures that encode semantic information in a fairly domain independent and robust manner is extremely difficult . a quick review of computer vision research over the last few years points to this difficulty . in many cases , image content can be used in conjunction with user interaction and domain specificity to retrieve semantically meaningful information . however , it is clear that retrieval by similarity of visual attributes when used arbitrarily cannot provide semantically meaningful information . for example , a search for a red flower by color red on a very heterogeneous database cannot be expected to yeild meaningful results . on the other hand retrieval of red flowers in a database of flowers can be achieved using color . in context therefore , examples of research using content and organization of multimedia information into semantic classes will be discussed . many systems , particularly image and video based ones require an example picture which can be used as a query ( alternatively , the user may be required to draw a picture ) . it may be unrealistic to expect an example image to be always available . thus , it would be useful to find ways of generating new queries . can nlp techniques be combined with computer vision techniques to generate such queries ? or can multimodal retrieval techniques be combined to create queries suitable for image , video and audio retrieval ? in general , a question is how can we create realistic queries for realistic systems . the third focus of this workshop is on evaluation techniques for multimedia retrieval . currently , most researchers are using the standard evaluation measures defined for text documents ; these need to be extended / modified for multimedia documents . there is also a high degree of subjectivity involved that needs to be addressed . we will focus on the following specific topics : - content analysis and retrieval from various media ( text , images , video , audio ) - interaction of modalities ( e . g . text , images ) in indexing , retrieval - effective user interfaces ( permitting query refinement etc . ) - evaluation methodologies for multimedia information . we have found that researchers pay insufficient attention to it . - techniques for relevance ranking - multimodal query formation / decomposition - logic formalisms for multimodal queries - indexing and retrieval from scanned documents - e . g extracting text from images , word spotting - as a retrieval technique for both handwritten and printed documents . - testbeds for evaluating multimodal retrieval : it would be nice to have some resource sharing here since annotating these , and coming up with a good query set are difficult participation : two types of participation are expected . those interested in making a presentation at this workshop should submit their full papers either in online postscript version or in hardcopy by regular mail to the address given below . the papers should not exceed 5 , 000 words , including figures , tables , and references . those interested in participating , but not presenting papers , should submit a statement of interest , not to exceed 500 words . this should clearly state what aspect ( s ) of the workshop reflect their research interest . these will be used to select panelists . both types of submissions are due on friday , june 5th . decisions will be made no later than friday , june 26th . in the case of paper submission , the final camera-ready papers are due on july 24th . working notes will be made available to all participants at the workshop . all the submissions should be sent to : prof . rohini k . srihari , cedar / suny at buffalo ub commons 520 lee entrance , suite 202 amherst , ny 14228 - 2583 rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu organization : workshop chairs ( also program chairs ) rohini k . srihari , suny at buffalo ( rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) zhongfei zhang , suny at buffalo ( zhongfei @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) r . manmatha , university of massachussetts ( manmatha @ cs . umass . edu ) s . ravela , university of massachussetts ( ravela @ cs . umass . edu ) program committee members : shih - fu chang ( columbia u . , usa ) david harper ( robert gordon university , u . k . ) alex hauptmann ( cmu , usa ) rakesh kumar ( sarnoff , usa ) desai narasimhalu ( isi , singapore ) candace sidner ( lotus , usa ) peter schauble ( eth , switzerland ) timetable : paper or statement of interest submission : june 5th , 1998 decision : july 3rd , 1998 camera - ready paper due : july 24th , 1998 sigir conference : august 24th - 28th , 1998 workshop : august 29th , 1998 further information : further questions may be directed to the address above , or go to the web page of this workshop at http : / / www . cedar . buffalo . edu / sigir98 / mmtr . html or the sigir conference main web page at http : / / www . cs . mu . oz . au / sigir98 / "	0

"Subject: kornfilt : turkish  jaklin kornfilt ( 1997 ) , turkish . london and new york : routledge . xxxi + 575 pp . 110 , us $ 180 . reviewed by steve seegmiller , montclair state university . jaklin kornfilt 's grammar of turkish ( hereafter referred to as turkish ) is the first new , comprehensive grammar of this language to be published in english in more than two decades . as such , its appearance is a significant event , especially since its author is a well known and respected authority on turkish . this is the latest title in the descriptive grammars series , edited by bernard comrie and published by routledge . the goals of the works in this series are different from those of most grammars : the descriptive grammars are intended for linguists rather than general users . all of the grammars in the series address the same issues in a uniform format so that a given feature may be easily compared across languages , and they contain information of a sort that is often absent from more traditional grammars . toward the end of the review i will comment briefly on the potential utility of this grammar for non-linguists , but for the most part i will focus on usefulness of the grammar for linguists . the descriptive grammars series now includes nearly 30 titles . according to the editorial preface , the series gives preference to languages for which comprehensive descriptions are not presently available ( iv ) . the aim of the series is to provide information to linguists who are interested in language typology , language universals , and comparative grammar , employing a terminology and a notation that will make the information accessible to linguists regardless of their particular specialization or orientation . authors of the grammars in the series are expected to organize their descriptions as answers to a series of questions ( originally published in lingua vol . 42 , no . 1 , 1977 ) . turkish contains over 600 pages , including the prefatory material , the table of contents , and the bibliography . the grammatical description alone amounts to just over 550 pages . it is thus roughly twice as long as lewis ( 1967 ) and about 100 pages longer than underhill ( 1976 ) . the book contains five chapters of widely varying lengths . chapter 1 ( syntax ) contains 211 pages , chapter 2 ( morphology ) 270 pages , chapter 3 ( phonology ) 32 pages , chapter 4 ideophones and interjections ) just 3 pages , and chapter 5 ( lexicon ) 16 pages . thus approximately 90 per cent of the book is devoted to morphology and syntax . furthermore , a good deal of the information in the morphology chapter deals with syntactic matters , giving the book an especially heavy bias toward syntax . . this distribution of information no doubt reflects both the interests of the author and the current emphasis of typological research . the chapters on phonology and the lexicon are both very well done and very useful ( more on this below ) , but they do not address all of the issues that might be of interest to a phonologist or a lexical semanticist . a notable feature of the book is the extensive and detailed table of contents . it is eleven pages long and , used in conjunction with the fourteen-page index , provides easy access to the an extensive body of information about turkish . how well does turkish accomplish its goals ? i think it handles syntax and morphology marvelously well , phonology and the lexicon adequately , and ideophones and interjections in a cursory fashion . the chapters on syntax and morphology provide the best , most detailed descriptions of these parts of the language available . the analyses are up to date and insightful , and kornfilt has done a superb job of bringing clarity to some of the most difficult parts of the language . in concept and terminology , the description straddles the line between generative and traditional or non-generative approaches . for instance , kornfilt uses the terms ' possessive adjective ' ( 105 ) and 'd emonstrative adjective ( 106 ) rather than the more usual ' possessive ' and 'd emonstrative . ' similarly , the descriptions are stated in terms of surface phenomena and grammatical constructions and not in any recognizable theoretical framework . this is probably the right choice , given the diverse backgrounds of the probable users of the grammar . the range of coverage is broad and thorough . kornfilt deals with sentence types , both simple and complex ; with negation and questions ; with grammatical categories and phrase types ; and with most of the other grammatical phenomena that might interest linguists . the morphology chapter contains information not just on inflection and derivation , but also on the uses of the various morphological forms . cross - referencing is extensive , making it easy for the reader to find all of the relevant information on a topic even if it is not found in the same section of the book . this approach of interrelating syntax and morphology is very useful and allows kornfilt to clarify some of the cloudy areas of turkish grammar . perhaps most notable are her treatments of the participial and nominal systems and their relation to subordination ( pp . 323-413 and at various places in chapter 1 ) . finite subordination is rare in turkish . a far more frequent pattern of subordination involves the use of a participial or nominalized verbal stem . the complexity of the system is mind-boggling to students of the language , but kornfilt 's description makes it coherent and intelligible . her treatment of other aspects of turkish morphology and syntax are equally well done . a very useful feature of turkish is the inclusion of information about what does * not * occur in the language . this is often essential information for linguists ( whether studying typology , syntax , or morphology ) and is rarely included in more traditional grammars . thus we find on page 104 the statement that postpostitions govern only one case ( with the lone exception of ' kadar ' ) . in lewis ( 1967 ) , this information can be inferred from the discussion of cases on pages 85-95 , but it is not so easy to find and not so categorically stated . there are many similar examples , especially in the syntax chapter . the chapter on phonology is short , clear , and precise , but it does not contain the amount of detail found in the syntax and morphology chapters . while the information presented will be adequate for many purposes , phonologists will no doubt wish for more elaborate discussions of issues like vowel harmony , stress assignment , and phonological ( or morphophonemic ) alternations . i found one omission in this chapter . on page 491 , the final devoicing rule is described as applying to syllable-final plosives and affricates , yet on page 487 there are examples of final devoicing of liquids as well , described as being standard but not universal . a cross-reference would have been useful here . for the most part , transcriptions in the phonology chapter follow the ipa norms . one exception , though , is the transcription of palatalized consonants by means of a comma rather than a raised j . ' while this may have been done for typographical reasons , it might confuse a casual user . chapter 4 , ideophones and interjections , is only 3 pages long and provides only the briefest commentary on these phenomena . while many linguists ( myself included ) will not mind the short shrift given to these topics , some will no doubt be disappointed that the list of ideophones occupies less than a page and a half . chapter 5 , lexicon , is a short but interesting sample of the lexicon of turkish . the chapter contains lists of words organized by semantic field . these include kinship terminology , color terms , body parts , and cooking terminology . also included is a list of just over 200 items of "" basic vocabulary , "" which seems to correspond to the so-called swadesh list . linguists interested in historical linguistics and language classification will be grateful to find this set of words conveniently collected together . setting aside some minor qualifications , as a reference work on turkish for linguists , turkish has no equal . it is more comprehensive , more up to date , and more effectively organized than any other description of the language . the method of organization , as well as the detailed table of contents and the index , make a wealth of information available almost instantaneously . it is , simply put , an admirable reference work on turkish for linguists . the same can not be said about the utility of turkish for non-linguists . there are two main reasons why the book will not be accessible to non-linguistic audiences . first , kornfilt assumes familiarity with linguistic terminology . in the very first paragraph on page 1 , for example , she uses the terms ' nominalized clause ' and ' constituent clause , ' neither of which is likely to be familiar to non-linguists . second , turkish presupposes an interest in and a knowledge of certain linguistic questions . kornfilt has little to say , for example , about questions of stylistic variation , formal versus colloquial speech , or any of a range of topics that the typical student or scholar of turkish might be interested in . this is not really a criticism , since the descriptive grammar series has a well defined audience that excludes non-linguists . nevertheless , it is unfortunate that the grammar will not be useful to a wider audience . it will supplement but will not replace lewis ( 1976 ) and underhill ( 1976 ) . i have just two complaints about turkish . first , there is a relatively large number of errors and inconsistencies . most are minor and consist of missing ' - s 's on verbs , using ' of ' for ' or , ' etc . , but some will cause confusion . on page 27 , for example , turkish is described as a 's ubject-verb - object language . ' ( it is actually s - o - v . ) a sentence on page 30 , which addresses the of question whether pied-piping of postpositions is obligatory , leaves the reader unsure of the answer . there are also some contradictions . on page 142 , the claim is made that the reflexive can never occur in subject position , but on page 305 we learn that the reflexive can occur as an honorific subject and on page 542 three references are given to works that discuss reflexive subjects in subordinate clauses . other inconsistencies are found in the bibliography , where some turkish titles are translated into english and others are not . the author is aware of some of the errors and has prepared an addendum which contains a short list of errata , but many of the errors that i found are not included . the addendum is available free of charge from the author or the publisher . my other complaint concerns the cost of turkish . at us $ 180 , the grammar is unlikely to find its way into many private libraries . this is unfortunate ; since the book is so useful , linguists interested in turkish will want to have it close at hand . references lewis , g . l .

( one of the reasons people find writing difficult is that they do not feel comfortable with the ' me ' they are portraying in their writing . academic writing in particular often poses a conflict of identity for students in higher education , because the 's elf ' which is inscribed in academic discourse feels alien to them . ) the main claim of this book is that writing is an act of identity in which people align themselves with socio-culturally shaped subject positions , and thereby play their part in reproducing or challenging dominant practices and discourses , and the values , beliefs and interests which they embody . the first part of the book reviews recent understandings of social identity , of the discoursal construction of identity , of literacy and identity , and of issues of identity in research on academic writing . the main part of the book is based on a collaborative research project about writing and identity with mature-age students , providing : o a case study of one writer 's dilemmas over the presentation of self ; o a discussion of the way in which writers ' life histories shape their presentation of self in writing ; o an interview-based study of issues of ownership , and of accommodation and resistance to conventions for the presentation of self ; linguistic analysis of the ways in which multiple , often contradictory , interests , values , beliefs and practices are inscribed in discourse conventions , which set up a range of possibilities for self-hood for writers . the book ends with implications of the study for research on writing and identity , and for the learning and teaching of academic writing . the book will be of interest to students and researchers in the fields of social identity , literacy , discourse analysis , rhetoric and composition studies , and to all those concerned to understand what is involved in academic writing in order to provide wider access to higher education . writing development . an interdisciplinary view edited by : clotilde pontecorvo , universita di roma , "" la sapienza "" , italy 1997 xxxii , 338 pp . studies in written language & literacy , 6 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 324 6 price : us $ 69 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 1799 8 price : nlg 138 john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com this volume presents a selection of papers presented at a series of three workshops organized by the network "" written language and literacy "" as launched by the european science foundation . the main topics making up writing development are : ( 1 ) writing and literacy acquisition : links between speech and writing , with contributions by david r . olson , claire blanche - benveniste , emilia ferreiro , ruth berman , liliana tolchinsky & ana teberosky ; ( 2 ) writing and reading in time and culture , with contributions by collette sirat , francoise desbordes , harmut gunther , peter koch , & jean hebrard : ( 3 ) written language competence in monolingual and bilingual contexts , with contributions by michel fayol & serge mouchon , georges ludi , & ludo verhoeven ; ( 4 ) writing systems , brain structures and languages : a neurolinguistic view , with contributioris by giuseppe cossu , heinz wiimmer & uta frith , & brian butterworth . the volume heads off with an extensive introduction "" studying writing and writing acquisition today : a multidisciplinary view "" . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - bernadette martinez - keck tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 publicity / marketing fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 john benjamins north america e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com "	0

4 , 1999 at the palazzo ducale in genova , italy introduction the international symposia on intelligent industrial automation ( iia ' 99 ) and soft computing ( soco ' 99 ) intend to encompass short-to - long-term effects of advanced information technology , soft computing and other related ' intelligent technolgies ' in application fields such as industrial automation , control , diagnostics , computer vision , robotics , speech recognition and machine translation . the general aim of the symposia is to address and underline the existing and emerging relationships between automation , manufacturing and intelligent technolgies , with particular emphasis on soft computing . contributions are sought on intelligent automation and manufacturing with emphasis on current and potential applications , with a broad interest in all the engineering disciplines , computer science and related technology fields . following the success of iia / soco ' 96 ( reading , england ) and iia / soco ' 97 ( nmes , france ) , the third symposium will be held in genova , italy . the iia / soco series have established themselves as a platform for scientists and practitioners from academic , governmental and industrial institutions to discuss new developments and results in the field of intelligent technologies . a further follow-up conference has already been scheduled for the year 2001 in paisley , scotland . purpose of iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 advances in soft computing and related techniques : theory and applications . ait ( advanced information technology ) is one of the major technological drivers in the advancement of modern society . nowadays any major achievement , related to any field of research , is strongly supported by proper ait based tools . very often , such achievements have only been possible after a proper ait approach has been designed and implemented . it is widely known that ait has a very strong impact on society itself , radically changing the skills and competencies required in order to contribute to the everyday human environment . given that nowadays the major effort in ait development is spent in the so called ' soft - computing ' arena and that some of the major and indeed , surprising , achievements in industrial applications come from the application of soft-computing techniques , the two symposia ( iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 ) will have many common areas of interest , namely : - neural networks - fuzzy logic - genetic algorithms - chaos theory - ai and expert systems - machine learning - pattern recognition and image understanding the programs of the two conferences will , however , reflect different themes : - iia ' 99 will be directed toward the medium-to - short term , application driven , research area in intelligent technologies . - soco ' 99 is directed toward the long term research in area of soft computing in order to try to overcome the usual borderline existing between theory and application , the two symposia are run jointly , organized in a way to have partial overlap with some joint sessions and some common plenary sessions . aim of iia ' 99 / soco ' 99 1 . to give both a wide and a deep view of advances in ait advancement offered by soft-computing technologies . 2 . to give both the industrial and academic researcher the opportunity to discuss together real problems and opportunities . 3 . to collect ' best practice ' and information on how to perform experiments , tests and design products and processes embedding and / or using soft-computing technologies . 4 . to explicitly and actively function as a ' technology broker ' , giving the opportunity for people to become aware of new problems and possible solutions and giving the possibility of finding technological partners for joint research and / or future application programs . topics of iia ' 99 iia ' 99 will include contributions in the research area of soft computing application and , more in general , related to medium-to - short term and application driven developments advanced information technology and industrial intelligent technology . particular emphasis will be laid on industrial realization , experimental application , application methodology development and / or formalization , quantitative and qualitative problem modeling . contributions are sought mainly in the areas based on the list below : a ) industrial area - industry - energy - transportation - services - consumer - etc . b ) high - tech area - innovative control and diagnostics - computer vision - robotics and remote sensing - speech recognition and machine translation - etc . c ) green - tech area - intelligent resource management - intelligent pollutant management - user behavior modeling - intelligent traffic control - etc . topics of soco ' 99 soco ' 99 will include contributions on long term research ( theory development , enhanced approaches , formal methods comparisons , applications , etc . ) in the area of soft-computing . contributions are sought in areas based on the list below , which is indicative only . - neural networks - fuzzy logic - rough sets - genetic algorithms and evolutionary computing - chaos theory - ai and expert systems - probabilistic reasoning - machine learning - learning algorithms and intelligent control - pattern recognition and image understanding - distributed intelligence - self - organizing systems - fuzzy databases and information retrieval - educational aspects of soft computing special session a special session on ' intelligent systems in control and process optimization ' including a plenary lecture is sponsored by the ifs network and organized by alberto servida , italy . contributions are welcome . conference location the symposia will be held at the palazzo ducale , a beautiful historic building in the city centre of genova , italy sponsors iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 are sponsored by : -

' this book provides a scholarly and well-illustrated theoretical and historical background to the field of error analysis . a range of relevant questions is addressed such as whether native speakers make errors , and whether ` good english ' for the native speaker is also good for the foreign learner . the reader is led from definitions of error and related concepts , to categorization of types of linguistic deviance , discussion of error gravities , the utility of teacher correction and towards writing learner profiles . throughout , the book is guided by considerable practical experience in language education in a range of classroom contexts worldwide . further information on the books published in this series , and the table of contents for these titles can be viewed at the longman linguistics on-line catalogue at : http : / / www . awl-he . com / linguistics for a complete listing of our world-wide offices , please click below : http : / / www . awl-he . com / offices 	0

Subject: new books : bilingualism  john benjamins publishing would like to call your attention to the following new titles in the field of language acquisition : government and code switching explaining american finnish helena halmari 1997 xvi , 276 pp . studies in bilingualism , 12 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 546 x price : us $ 89 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 4118 x price : hfl . 178 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com bilingual codeswitching is a complex , multifaceted phenomenon , which calls for explanations on several different linguistic levels . this volume focuses on one such level : the level of syntax . an explanation for the regularities and consistencies in the codeswitching patterns of american finns in their spontaneous conversations is sought for in the universal grammar - based principle of government as realized in case-assignment and agreement relations . a bulk of the finnish - english intrasentential data get their explanation on the structural , hierarchical level , but this level of syntax is found to be interestingly intertwined with sociolinguistic , psycholinguistic , and discourse levels , which all contribute to variation in codeswitching patterns . the proposed principle of government is seen as one important explanation in typologically certain kinds of language pairs such as finnish and english ; however , this principle is not treated as a monolithic constraint , bur rather as the leading tendency which is occasionally overridden by other than syntactic forces . the volume is intended as a complement - not as a contradiction - to earlier explanations of codeswitching phenomena . its main message is : while all linguistic levels contribute to the construction of bilingual speech , the importance of syntax can not be ignored . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - bernadette martinez - keck tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 publicity / marketing fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 john benjamins north america e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com 	0

856-4186 to communicate your problem . driving : if you arrive by car from the north or east , exit i-465 ( the circle road around indianapolis ) onto highway 67 at the sw corner of the city , and head south about 45 miles ; turn south ( left ) only highway 231 about 10 miles north of spenser , and at the first stoplight in spenser ( one of only three ! ) turn left ( east ) onto highway 46 . go two miles , then turn left into the park at a well-marked entrance . at the gate , state that your are arriving for the slavic workshop , and they will admit you without the $ 2 admission charge ) . the canyon inn is about 1 km into the park along the main road , and it is well marked . if you arrive from the south , take i-65 to highway 46 at columbus , indiana . exit west ( left ) and travel 50-60 miles through bloomington to the park , which will be on the right just before spenser . > from the west , take i-70 towards indianapolis , and exit onto highway 231 . travel about 30 miles south to spenser , then follow the directions above . > from bloomington , spenser is 15 miles to the west along highway 46 ( drive west on 17th st , which becomes 46 as it leaves bloomington ) . email me if you require additional transportation information ! accommodations the workshop will be held at the canyon inn on the territory of mccormick 's creek state park . two types of rooms are available : 1 double bed ( $ 60 / night ) 2 single beds ( $ 60 / night as single , $ 30 / person / night as double ) the rooms are small but quite nice , all with air conditioning , private bath , color tv , and the usual furnishings . we have contracted to pay the inn directly for our block of rooms ( thus saving all taxes , since we are a tax-exempt organization ! ) , and therefore you should make reservations with us via email , fax , etc . , and plan to pay us for your room upon arrival at the workshop . we prefer checks , if possible , but will take cash happily and can take credit cards if there is no other alternative ( we will have to handle this through slavica , as if you were purchasing books instead of paying for the room ) . the canyon inn has a swimming pool , and various outdoor recreation facilities are available ( hiking through the woods , horseback riding for a fee , etc . ) , so pack accordingly if you plan to take advantage of these opportunities during the workshop ! expect hot and humid weather , with daily temperatures reaching or exceeding 30 degrees celsius . overflow rooms are available at the patriot inn , about 1 km from the park entrance . these rooms cost about $ 44 single plus $ 4 - 5 per additional person in room . they are not as nice as the canyon inn rooms , and staying away from the workshop diminishes the coziness of the workshop experience , so we will not use them unless we run out of space at the canyon inn ( and this does not appear to be a problem at the moment ) . if you have to stay there , we will provide transportation to and from the conference site . if you want to stay in bloomington for a few days before or after the workshop , we have blocked some rooms in eigenmann hall , a graduate dormitory with single rooms , on-premises cafeteria , and within walking distance of our library . rooms cost about $ 28 / day ( food is not included ) , and may be paid for by credit card , cash , or checks . you should request these rooms through me in advance of the workshop , specifying arrival and departure dates . food the conference will provide the following meals at no charge to participants ( if you are accompanied by a spouse or children , they are welcome to join us but you must pay for their food ; email me for details ) . it is very important that i have an exact count before the conference , as i must provide this information to the canyon inn , so please keep me informed of your plans friday evening : outdoor picnic dinner ( barbecue chicken and ribs , various other dishes ; vegetarians can feast on salads etc . ; indoors if it rains ) saturday morning : coffee / juice / pastries / fruit at the conference room saturday lunch : buffet with sandwiches , salads , beverages , etc . sunday morning : same as saturday morning . saturday evening and sunday lunch are not provided for . i figure many people might want to go to a restaurant in bloomington , but there is a decent restaurant in the canyon inn as well , and one pleasant-looking hilltop restaurant in spenser as well . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * george fowler [ email ] gfowler @ indiana . edu dept . of slavic languages [ dept . tel . ] 1-812 -

or can multimodal retrieval techniques be combined to create queries suitable for image , video and audio retrieval ? in general , a question is how can we create realistic queries for realistic systems . the third focus of this workshop is on evaluation techniques for multimedia retrieval . currently , most researchers are using the standard evaluation measures defined for text documents ; these need to be extended / modified for multimedia documents . there is also a high degree of subjectivity involved that needs to be addressed . we will focus on the following specific topics : - content analysis and retrieval from various media ( text , images , video , audio ) - interaction of modalities ( e . g . text , images ) in indexing , retrieval - effective user interfaces ( permitting query refinement etc . ) - evaluation methodologies for multimedia information . we have found that researchers pay insufficient attention to it . - techniques for relevance ranking - multimodal query formation / decomposition - logic formalisms for multimodal queries - indexing and retrieval from scanned documents - e . g extracting text from images , word spotting - as a retrieval technique for both handwritten and printed documents . - testbeds for evaluating multimodal retrieval : it would be nice to have some resource sharing here since annotating these , and coming up with a good query set are difficult participation : two types of participation are expected . those interested in making a presentation at this workshop should submit their full papers either in online postscript version or in hardcopy by regular mail to the address given below . the papers should not exceed 5 , 000 words , including figures , tables , and references . those interested in participating , but not presenting papers , should submit a statement of interest , not to exceed 500 words . this should clearly state what aspect ( s ) of the workshop reflect their research interest . these will be used to select panelists . both types of submissions are due on friday , june 5th . decisions will be made no later than friday , june 26th . in the case of paper submission , the final camera-ready papers are due on july 24th . working notes will be made available to all participants at the workshop . all the submissions should be sent to : prof . rohini k . srihari , cedar / suny at buffalo ub commons 520 lee entrance , suite 202 amherst , ny 14228 - 2583 rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu organization : workshop chairs ( also program chairs ) rohini k . srihari , suny at buffalo ( rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) zhongfei zhang , suny at buffalo ( zhongfei @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) r . manmatha , university of massachussetts ( manmatha @ cs . umass . edu ) s . ravela , university of massachussetts ( ravela @ cs . umass . edu ) program committee members : shih - fu chang ( columbia u . , usa ) david harper ( robert gordon university , u . k . ) alex hauptmann ( cmu , usa ) rakesh kumar ( sarnoff , usa ) desai narasimhalu ( isi , singapore ) candace sidner ( lotus , usa ) peter schauble ( eth , switzerland ) timetable : paper or statement of interest submission : june 5th , 1998 decision : july 19th , 1998 camera - ready paper due : july 24th , 1998 sigir conference : august 24th - 28th , 1998 workshop : august 29th , 1998 further information : further questions may be directed to the address above , or go to the web page of this workshop at http : / / www . cedar . buffalo . edu / sigir98 / mmtr . html or the sigir conference main web page at http : / / www . cs . mu . oz . au / sigir98 / "	0
